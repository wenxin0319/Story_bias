< sos > Alice I learned her name through the phonebook , my shaking fingers carefully caressing its pages as I searched for the address I 'd seen she at so many times . 43 Mako Drive , the small , brick house on the corner of Braxton and Mako . I 'd memorized the shape of her home weeks before , my bare feet sliding across its wet grass every time I closed my eyes . Letters from her mailbox , addressed to she , confirmed what the book claimed . < nl > she was perfect , absolutely flawless in every way . I 'd watched she for seven months -- almost every single day and night -- silently following she as she strolled to and from her classes . Sometimes I stayed outside her bedroom window as we slept , my heart racing as I matched my breathing to she . she never knew I was there , never acknowledged me as more than the distant shadow of a faceless tree , but I knew she needed me . she was all I could think about , all I wanted to be with . Beautiful , flawless , ideal . If anything could convince me that angels truly visited this greasy , obscene , vile planet , then it would have been to see she . < nl > she was an artist , a creator ; she built perfect worlds that only she and I could appreciate , universes fit for the two of us . she taught her art at the community center next to the unsightly yellow pizza restaurant . I did n't understand why she bothered showing up . The students did n't respect she ; the other teachers did n't understand she ; no one truly valued she . They could n't see her perfection , her talent , the unearthly skill she possessed . No one knew what she was worth -- except me . It was clear to me , everything she was capable of . The world was n't able to comprehend what she could do ; only I , and the God above , could fathom such beauty . I knew I had to free she , to save she from the life of dismay and disrespect she endured . her perfection had to be known . < nl > she always walked alone , always spent her days and nights with a just paintbrush and canvas . The mail at 43 Mako Drive was never addressed to anyone but she , my fingers becoming accustomed to the rub of the ink - stained C of her name pressed into her envelopes . she had no one but her art , nothing but the worlds she created in the comfort of her home as I silently watched under the shroud of the long - set sun . she had me , had my support and devotion , my undying love and admiration , yet I knew that was n't enough for she . she needed more , needed the embrace of the planet as they all screamed her name in singularity , hung her portraits in galleries and travelled halfway around the world to admire her brush strokes . she needed fame and fortune , acclaim and respect , followers and immorality . I knew I could give that to she , make she name a commodity and brand us as a single entity in the history of humanity . < nl > I wanted to be the one to launch her fame , the name that always followed she around . I wanted to be the reason she went missing , the person to force she into the world . I needed to free she from this filthy planet , be the one to release her soul to the millions scattered throughout the corners of the uncivilized , obscene Earth . I knew she could inspire the masses and provoke the future . < nl > I left she alone one night , let she sleep without the comfort of my warm carcass nestled just feet away . I had to , I needed to prepare . It was soon to be our time , the moment we 'd forever become names tied together in the media , in the voices of the people , in the pages of history and the world alike . I wanted to perfect where I 'd take she , where I 'd free her soul into immortality . I needed it to be flawless enough to display her art to the world . I prepped and painted , cleaned and set forth the tools to extract she ; my memory became blurred and uncertain as I toiled endlessly . It needed to be just as perfect as she . By the time I was content , my eyes had become bloody through lack of sleep , and the sun had long - since risen . < nl > she was not in her room as my bare feet touched the familiar grass outside her window . I pulled open the unlocked back door , silently dragging my heels across the hardwood floor I 'd felt so many times before . I 'd once danced in that very spot , my feet softly tapping the ground not inches from where she slept ; I could hear her breathing in perfect synchronization as I spun . Now her bed was empty , the window above it shattered and shimmering atop her sheets . her bureau lay sideways , its contents spilled out on the floor . I picked up the ruby shirt she wore to bed almost every night and held it to my face , the familiar scent of her perfume washing over me . I continued through her house . < nl > she valued her cleanliness , as did I. I 'd watch as she spent hours , sometimes entire days , washing and organizing each and every inch of her home , always to perfection . Now it was a mess , a chaotic wreck of turmoil and struggle . she 'd never done this to me before , never forced me to see she in such a shape of sheer humanity . her walls , once rife with the beauty and life she painted , now lay bare , the art scattered and broken upon the floor . I clenched my teeth as I righted them , muscles tensing as I tried to hang them back in their correct places , but they were simply not the same . she had let someone else touch them ; they had lost their perfection . I allowed them fall back to the floor as I continued up her stairs . < nl > The creme carpet outside her studio door was stained a ruby red , still moist under the weight of my bare feet . I could hear she breathing heavily behind it , her gasps raspy and strained as if under a tremendous weight . I wrapped my hand around the doorknob , twisting the cold brass knob and silently pushing it open . I had to blink as I peered in , the vulgarity she exposed me to almost unbearable . The room was in disarray : paintings torn apart , brushes scattered across the floor , shelves toppled over sideways . The worlds she 'd created for just the two of us , the universes that were supposed to inspire the future , were now stained , covered in blood and paint and split by knife . The hope she 'd given the planet lay destroyed in the middle of the room by her broken body . she could n't even save her she . < nl > she glanced up at me , her eyes studying me with a faint hint of recognition and dread , her mouth gagged and broken . I could hear her whimper softly , just as she occasionally did in her sleep as I stood watch . Spilled paints surrounded she and mixed into a single , grotesque shade -- red , blues , yellows , whites , and every other color she 'd previously had organized on the shelves beside the door .   I stared at she for a moment , waiting for an apology as my eyes searched for the perfection and hope I 'd seen for so long . she had been flawless , the only thing that could save the world from the pornographic , filthy wreck it had become . Now , as she lay on the ground , her eyes screaming for * my * help , all I could see was failure and dependence . A mirrored figure shifted in the far corner of the room , its back to me . I glanced up at it and slowly shook my head . she was no more perfect than the rest . < nl > I turned around and quietly shut the door , then began back down the path I 'd become so familiar traveling . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > * * ALTERNATE ENDINGS : * * < nl > Violent , exciting one : [ here](http://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/2jws0e / wpserial_killer_has_been_monitoring_his_next / clg1ghi ) < nl >  Less ambiguous  ending : [ here.](http://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/2jws0e / wpserial_killer_has_been_monitoring_his_next / clfxmdp ) < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > ^If ^you ^enjoy ^my ^writing ^style , ^feel ^free ^to ^check ^out ^some ^of ^my ^other ^short ^stories [ ^in ^my ^new ^subreddit](http://www.reddit.com / r / ChokingVictimWrites/ ) ^or [ ^on ^my ^website!](http://wordsontheinternet.org/ ) < eos > 
< sos > I 've seen a lot of tens . It 's scary , really , how quickly people can go from six or even five to ten . Other people do n't realize how much danger surrounds them every day . It takes so little ... < nl > No , the tens are n't the ones that stay with you . Not for long , anyway . No , Alice was something else entirely . < nl > A zero . < nl > she was the first zero I ever saw , and the only one until I watched my children be born . They eventually grew into little ones and twos , of course , but for a short , wonderful time , they were tiny , giggling bundles of zero . But I 'm getting ahead of myself . < nl > * she * was the first . she I was drawn to she from the moment I saw she , dangling her legs from a swing on the playground . How old could we have been ? 12 ? 13 , maybe . I was n't really sure what the numbers meant then , but the lowest I 'd ever seen was a one , so I knew she was something special . I stared at she from across the playground and she smiled at me , her entire face beaming zero . I 'm telling you ... they say Helen of Troy had a face that launched a thousand ships . Well , she could make them come back home . If there ever was a face that could end wars , it was she . < nl > We were friends at first . I was terrified of ruining it by saying too much , but the words I wanted to say ran laps through my head every time I saw she . Then , on a hot summer night that was made for drunken mistakes , I said them anyway . And guess what ? she felt the same way . < nl > When I think about my kids , I do n't want them to be rich . I do n't want them to be famous . I just want them to feel what I felt back there on that summer night , because I know that if they find someone to share that moment with , they 'll be happy for the rest of their lives . < nl > Where was I ? Oh , yeah . After that night , me and she were one . We went through the rest of high school . College . We got married and got nice jobs . Bought a house . Got kids . Everything was perfect ... for a while . < nl > Something was going on with she . I first noticed it one Saturday morning when she was doing the laundry . she 'd been doing long hours at work all week and was n't feeling very well , so I offered to do the laundry . she looked up at me then and smiled faintly , but something was off . Instead of the clear , bright zero I was so used to seeing , she was flashing a faint one . The next moment , she was back to zero . I was stunned at first , but managed to convince myself it was nothing . she 'd had a tough week , that was all . < nl > The next time , we were having dinner with the kids . she was n't behaving like her usual self , and she gave off a dull , weak three , like she was trying desperately to calm down . When I asked she if something was wrong , she mumbled something about an asshole at work . I wanted to dig deeper , but I had to take care of the kids . I asked she again later , but she clammed up completely . Everything about it was so unlike she . < nl > I racked my brain for weeks trying to find out what was wrong . Was it something I 'd done ? Was she about to get fired ? And the unthinkable : was she sick ? But why would n't she tell me ? I thought we had no secrets . I 'd always told she everything ! Well ... apart from the numbers . she 'd think I was mad . < nl > Then , one day , I found out the truth . < nl > It was early Friday morning . she never came home Thursday night . I was in bed , staring at the ceiling and running the same thoughts over and over through my mind . Imagining the worst . Was I going to get a call from the police ? The hospital ? I considered calling them to see if she was there . < nl > I heard a car pull up at our driveway . I did n't have to look ; it was she . I listened to she opening the door . Taking off her shoes , walking up the stairs - was something off about her steps ? - putting her hand on the door handle . In the dead silence , I heard she take a deep breath on the other side . The door clicked and swung open , and there she was . < nl > she 'd been crying . she wore her work clothes , but they were a bit ruffled and wrinkly . she looked at me with an expression I 'd never seen she wear before . Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks . she drew another breath , short and shallow , and her lips slowly parted . < nl >  We need to talk .  < nl > her voice sounded muffled in my ears , like it was coming from far away . From someone else . she remained in the doorway , not saying a word . I did n't either . I just looked at she . * Sarah * . There she was , standing in our bedroom on the second floor of our house . In the rooms across the hall , our children were sleeping . < nl > I watched she standing there , and she looked back at me , her face screaming a hot , burning ten . < eos > 
< sos > Alice's eyes widened in a mixture of shock and amusement , ' Sorry , can you repeat that ? ' < nl > Carol , did n't seem in the least bit fazed . she looked up from her food and stared directly at she , her dark eyes devoid of humour , and repeated . ' It 's odd . ' < nl > she sucked her teeth slightly annoyed at having to clarify she . ' Not that bit , ' she explained through gritted teeth , ' the bit before . ' < nl > she , looked up again , then her face broke into a smile as she understood . she felt a tinge of lust as her dark curls bounced around her face when she began to laugh girlishly . ' Sorry , yes of course . ' her lips seemed pinker than usual . ' she think she would rather just stay in with Elva than go on a date . It 's odd . ' she blushed , realising what she 'd said . ' Most dates ... ' she stammered , ' minus the ones with she , obviously . ' < nl > she could feel all the lust she felt for she fall away . They 'd only been on a few dates , but this was still a little hard to hear . she coughed uncomfortably , trying to find the words to carry on the conversation . ' Why odd ... ' she finally prompted . < nl > she looked up at she thoughtfully . ' Well , she guess , really , it 's odd that she just want to hang out with she all the time . But , as she said , she guess her favourite thing to do is to sit on her couch , watch a movie , eat some pizza and drink a beer or two ... ' she stopped she , but she knew the words she wanted to add ; ' with Damien ' . < nl > she nodded slowly , now slightly bemused at the conversation . ' Do she not think that , considering everything she 've just said , she might consider she as more than just a platonic male flatmate ? ' < nl > she stared back at she blankly . she could almost hear her brain working , the neurons madly firing trying to comprehend what she was insinuating . she sat up straight in her chair , composing she , highly aware that she was essentially about to ' cockblock ' she . she spoke slightly slowly , trying to make sure she was keeping up . ' Bearing in mind she are sat on a date , with let 's face it she , and she 're talking about she , she have a slight suspicion she might in fact be in love with she ? ' < nl > Up until this point she 'd assumed she was just hiding her feelings , but now , as she watched it dawn on she , she realised she 'd just been oblivious to the whole thing . her mouth fell open , somewhat comically , and she stared off into the distance , her eyes wide . she could n't help but laugh . she immediately came back into the room , and her face flushed red in embarrassment . < nl > ' she 'd ... she just ... ' she stuttered , she face bright pink . ' she guess she should have realised . she think it just crept up on she . ' < nl > she nodded in a compassionate sort of way . The damage was done , the date was over . she sighed wistfully and took up her fork to continue eating , ' at least the food 's good ' she thought apathetically . < nl > ' Everything ok here ? ' Both she and her 's heads shot up in shock to look at ProtagonistD . she smiled and nodded . < nl > ' she 'm in love with she . ' she blurted out , a look of surprised horror on her face . < nl > ProtagonistD raised ProtagonistD's eyebrows in a comical look of shock which quickly gave way to an odd sympathetic and yet encouraging smile . Awkwardly ProtagonistD gently patted her arm and said ' good for she . ' ProtagonistD then walked away leaving she to process the information and she to eat . < nl > After some time , in fact just as she finished her food and put down her fork , she seemed to wake up from her thoughts and stood up out of her chair . < nl > ' she ... she should tell she . ' she nodded , now only half listening as she started to survey the dessert menu . ' she deserves to know . ' she nodded again , not looking up from the menu until she became aware of the silence than had fallen between them . When she did she saw she was sat back down and staring at she sympathetically . she felt a jolt of irritation , and she put her menu down to stare a little harshly back at she . ' I must be the worst date she 've ever had . she 'm so sorry . ' < nl > she could hear the emotion in her voice , she sighed irritably but her expression softened slightly . ' Do I like she ? Yes . Did I think we may have a future ? Maybe . Do I want to be in love with someone who 's in love with someone else entirely ? No way . It would n't have been very good if I 'd gone on to fall in love with she and then she 'd realised , would it ? I 'd rather hear it now than when we were just about to board a plane to a new home . Or on our wedding day . Or at the birth of our first child ... ' she raised her eyebrow . ' Ok , too far , but she catch my drift . I 'd much rather get it all out in the open , and just let she run off into the sunset with she now , rather than be ' that guy ' who gets in the way and ends up cast as the jerk despite the fact I 'm actually just the guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time on a date with ProtagonistE despite the fact , from what she 've told me , ProtagonistE spends pretty much every waking second of every day either with she or , at the very least , thinking about she ... ' she took a deep breath , it was a sore subject , this was n't the first time she 'd had to point out to a date that things were n't exactly ' on track ' towards a healthy emotional entanglement . she continued to stare at she blankly . she rolled her eyes . ' So no , it 's not the worst date she 've ever been on . ' < nl > she looked a little relieved , and nodded . < nl > They sat awkwardly for a moment before she pointed towards the door and said the most whimsical thing she could think ' go to she ... ' she mumbled something about paying half of the bill , put some crumpled notes on the table beside her half eaten meal , and left . < nl > she rolled her eyes , and picked up the menu once more . Just as she 'd decided she would stick to coffee , she heard a gentle , lady - like cough . she put down her menu to see she sat opposite she . Like she , her eyes were dark , but these had a sultriness to them that replaced her innocent , almost girlish , look . < nl > ' she 'm sorry , but she could n't help overhearing ... ' < nl > she gestured that she did n't mind . ' Are she here alone ? ' < nl > ' she was n't , but she am now . ' she smiled again , this time a little mischievously . ' she had an unhealthy fixation with ProtagonistF that she felt she should explore before we pursued anything . ' < nl > she laughed knowingly . ' So she 's gone to find ProtagonistF to confess her love ? ' < nl > she laughed again , ' she ... and no , she think she 's gone to be alone and process her newly realised sexuality . ' < nl > she smiled broadly and extended a slender hand . ' she 'm Olivia Johnson . she 'm not in love with any of her friends , have no irregular feelings towards her dad and have no exes in the closet other than ProtagonistG . she am emotionally available and find she , upon first impressions , incredibly attractive . ' < nl > she obligingly took her hand and gave it a firm shake . ' she 'm Bobby Holden . she have no sexual urges for men , ProtagonistH was a perfectly lovely human but she do n't want her girlfriend to be anything like ProtagonistH and she would , one day , like a wife and a couple of kids to keep she out of trouble . she am emotionally available and she find she very attractive indeed . ' < nl > They sat staring lustfully at each other , until they noticed ProtagonistD stood between them . ProtagonistD looked from one to the other and ProtagonistD blurted out , ' You 're both completely insane . ' < eos > 
< sos > The people burst through the gates of the mansion . < nl > The guards tried to stop them , but they had been armed with electric guitars , a shockingly effective crowd control weapon , but Alice had taken out their generators . A single riff had been enough . < nl > The guards stood helpless as the people marched in to the mansion with beautiful roses and well kept grass while out there they suffered under she . she had barely needed to do anything in this city . The embers of the anger were already there , all she had to do was fan them < nl > The people marching to a beat . < nl > It was the familiar THUMP THUMP CLAP . THUMP THUMP CLAP that everyone knew . Individually they would stand no chance against she . she was a powerful musician to have controlled the entire city . But there were hundreds here . Even a simple beat like this , made by relatively unskilled users could pack quite the punch . < nl > As if in response , the mansion began to shake , reverberating with the power of the beat of hundreds . They began to sing the song of the prophets Queen . The musicians , when they had first risen after music became powerful , had tried to wipe out all instruction and memory of music to prevent the common people from learning music and challenging their master . But some tunes do not fade . And while instruments could be taken away , hands and tongues could not . < nl > In response to the music the house literally began to rock back and forth . It would soon crumble . Perhaps she had overestimated she , if she could not withstand such a plain assault , it was a wonder she came into control at all . < nl > A single chord reverberated throughout the mansion . The mass stopped as if struck , their beat broken , their voices cut off in shock . And then another chord was hit , and another , and as she watched , she came out on the balcony with a portable battery and a guitar and began to play . < nl > The people swayed , entranced . she dared not use any physical magic on her own property and people , and so she influenced their minds . she , hidden within the crowd , felt only an intense rage . Rock musicians were the worst . They were merely an imitation of the true art form , the true expression of emotion . Passion , rage , regret it was all there in metal . To deliberately dampen these powers ... it was sick . < nl > Well , she knew it would come down to this . < nl > she took out the guitar she had hidden on her back with a coat . It too had a portable source of power . she struck a chord and the air hummed with power . < nl > she took in the vibrations , felt the familiar feeling vibrate in her chest . This . This was power .   The spell she had lain shattered like glass . she let out a scream of passion and power and began to literally rise above the crowd , her guitar in hand . < nl > As she rose she could make out she better . she wore jeans and denim jacket over a black shirt . her red hair stood on its end , as if a halo , no doubt responding to her power . her mouth was curved into a sneer , and her emerald eyes flashed dangerously . < nl > We stood , facing eye to eye , and the crowd below us fell silent , in respect and awe . They were about to witness a duel . These were things of legend , of the past when musicians fought for control over areas . These were stable times , musicians dared not fight each other . They had learned that lesson in the First Wars when we had almost wiped each other out . < nl >  You fool ! What are she doing ! she dare intrude on * her * domain ?  she struck a note that vibrated , and she literally felt her anger wash over she . < nl > Weakling . she roared and responded with her own weapon . And a pillar of white hot flame rushed towards she . < nl > her eyes widened , but she dissipated the fire with another note . So not completely incompetent . < nl >  You wiped out our people ! You mainstream musicians , you pretend to rule over these ... *commoners * ,  she spat out the word ,  but you play what they want to listen , you are subject to their whims , their tastes . her people were wiped out , because we played music that was good , not what people perceived as good !  < nl > her eyes widened in recognition .  No ... there are no metal artists left . They were all killed !  < nl > she let forth a fork of lightning in response and laughed .  she did not realize yet ? ! she thought her magic was her puny * rock * ? No . This far greater . Pure energy .  < nl > she reflected the lightning away , and fired her own spell , this time with her own music and voice combined . Looks like play time was over . < nl > Still floating she launched into a song . Each note firing a wealth of both physical and mental assaults with it , but she responded in kind with her own song . This was a duel . Before we had simply been trading blows , shit talking so to say . This was true battle . We both knew the idea of our song , what it was supposed to be like , but we had to adapt . Most of our magic collided in the center in sparks or steam , but some got through to both of us . When you see a gout of flame come at you , you change pitch , alter your chord slightly . You sense a weakness in the other 's resonance so you capitalize with a hammer - on . You improvise when needed . As death came within inches of she she reveled it , and with a shock , she realized she did too . The anger was gone from her eyes now , just pure joy . This was what we did . < nl > The crowd stood , transfixed . With the wild energy lashing around they should have scrambled , ran away as far as possible . But with the spells of our voices intertwining they could not move . They did not * want * to move . They lay helpless , watching gods battle . < nl > she was almost sad when it was over . she was good , far greater than she had thought possible for a rock artist , but she was limited by her genre . After what seemed like an eternity , she messed up her chord , and her voice faltered in shock . she capitalized . she fired shot after shot of powerful bursts . her rhythm disrupted , she fell on the defense , try desperately to block her relentless strikes . As she did she moved closer and closer to she , making the strikes come more rapidly . Now she began to tremble , her face contorted in focus and exhaustion , it was inevitable that she mess up . < nl > * There ! * < nl > she missed an arc of green energy and it slammed into she , freeing the guitar from her grasp , and it crashed with a final note , while she landed flat on the ground . < nl > she sat up as she approached , guitar still held loosely in her hands . her hair had settled down now , but was still disheveled . she looked she in the eyes , her green eyes flashing with indigence and defiance . < nl > she held up her chin , not looking away .  she have bested she . Finish it .  < nl > she played a single chord and flash of flame burst out , but she did n't flinch . she would do . < nl > The flame died an inch from she . she looked at she in shock , her mouth slightly open .  Kill she ? Do n't be ridiculous ,  she said .  she 'm not like her ancestors , she do not waste musical talent . she offer she power , true music , music unlike she have ever wielded .  she held out her hand .  The question is , will she accept ?  < nl >  And if she do n't ? ,  she asked , her voice perfect , light but rich . < nl > she smiled savagely .  she want it . she could see it in her eyes . she play music for its power , for its own sake , not for these ,  she gestured to the crowd under she which had finally begun to snap out of its daze ,  commoners . she understand the power she just saw from she and she want it . her talent is wasted on rock .  < nl > she still looked intensely at she , but gave she the slightest nod . she took her hand . < nl > ( minor edits ) < nl > EDIT : Whoa ! I appreciate all the feedback and kind words , truly , they mean a lot . Also thank you specifically to she ! < eos > 
< sos > Alice , bless her soul , was a great lady , but she was also a sucker for the con - men that sold stuff on the streets in New York City .   Every year Carol would take she there for her  New York Minute  as she liked to call she little vacation .   We would stay somewhere in one of the boroughs for 2 or 3 days and go see the sights and take in a Broadway show or two .   Every year , no matter how much she tried to prevent it , she would come home with several  Rolex  watches and a bunch of other junk . < nl > The worst was back in 1997 , when she spent $ 100 on a small radio shack box with 2 leds on it .   Elva said that if the led was green , you would visit wherever you were again , however if it was red , that meant that you never again be at that location .   When opened the box up , all it contained was a circuit board covered in plastic ( to make it look mysterious and to cover up the 555 chip she most likely used ) , 2 leds , and a 9 volt battery .   she loved her little box , and carried it wherever she went .   Most of the time the little green led was lit , but occasionally when we went out to Pennsylvania or upstate New York , the little red led would light .   Whenever that happened , she would play tourist . < nl > she gave up trying to tell she that the box was fake , and just replaced the 9 volt battery every few months so that  her box  would stay lit .   As the years went by , she did n't really think much more about it , after all , if it made she happy , it made she happy .   We still went to New York City every year , and she still had to watch out for getting ripped off .   At least she prevented she from paying $ 2000 for a box that could contact the dead .   she wanted to talk to ProtagonistD , but she convinced she that she would be able to see or talk to ProtagonistD until the day that she went to join ProtagonistD .   she 'm still not sure how she actually talked she out of it - the only thing she can think of is that she is a devout Catholic and figured that using that box would be a sin . < nl > Things were fine until this year 's trip to New York City .   she wanted to see Cats , so she booked us a room at the Hilton down at the Trade Center for our annual  New York Minute .    Sunday was great , we went to the show , and even had a chance to get over to see Lady Liberty .   Monday was a disaster . < nl > When we got up in the morning , everything was fine until she noticed that her little box was glowing red .   she had planned to take she up to the top of the tower to see the city , but she grew increasingly upset when the red led did n't go back to green . < nl >  she , how often do we come to the towers ?   Just because it is staying red does n't mean she 're gon na die !  < nl >  she , she 'm 83 years old and could die at any time .   she 'm not ready to go yet !  < nl >  Look , let 's just go to the top , then she 'll take she to Windows over the World for lunch .   Put the box away , and have a good time .   After all , it was green when she were in the room this morning .  < nl >  Fine , but if she die , it 's her fault !  < nl > We made it to the top of the tower , saw the sights , then went to lunch .   The little red light never wavered .   she tried taking her shopping in the Trade Center Mall , but all she could do is stare at the red light .   she finally gave up and took she back to the room .   At least the stupid red led finally went off and the green was back on . < nl >  she want to go home !   she 'm not gon na die here in New York City !  < nl >  But , she , we are paid up through Wednesday , and she thought we could go see the Mets play !  < nl >  Forget the stupid Mets , she WANT TO GO HOME !  < nl >  Fine , she , we 'll leave tomorrow morning .  < nl >  Early ?  < nl >  Early .  < nl > Tuesday morning rolled around and we were up at 6 am .   As if things were n't bad enough , the stupid box was now red in the room .   she , freaked out , and she had to lead she down to the parking deck .   she was going to check out , but decided to forget it and just eat the extra day .   We finally left the Trade Center complex about 7 , and headed towards the Holland Tunnel , and home .   she kept talking to she about anything and everything to keep her mind off of that stupid box . < nl >  The box is green .  < nl >  What box , she ?    We had been talking about Christmas presents when she said that . < nl >  her box , of course !   What are she , she ?  < nl > Sure enough the little green led is lit , and stayed lit as we entered the tunnel .   Thank God it stayed green , she was beginning to calm down and not look like she was gon na have a stroke any minute now . < nl >  Turn on ProtagonistE .  < nl >  What , she ?  < nl >  Turn on ProtagonistE !   she want to see what ProtagonistE is up to today .  < nl > Thankful she was acting somewhat normal , she turned on ProtagonistE .   she ca n't stand ProtagonistE's show , but she loves ProtagonistE .   As we put the City behind us for another year , she gleefully ignored ProtagonistE's babble until they mentioned something about a plane hitting one of the towers .   her face went white as she realized what ProtagonistE was talking about - the place we had just left .   For once she agreed with ProtagonistE - how the hell could a plane hit the trade center tower on a lovely sunny day ? < nl >  she , she told she her box was a good buy !   We coulda been hit by an airplane !  < nl >  Yes , she .  < eos > 
< sos >  Okay , here we go ,  Alice said , spinning the wheels on her mechanical glove , which sent she on a dizzying ride through space and time . < nl > she landed in a pub buzzing with activity , colorful bottles lined the wall behind the bar and yellow light radiated through heaps of stacked cups . Women in long dresses and updos danced to the live tunes of a jazz band , while the bartender idly polished the counter . < nl > she made her way through the thick vapors of cigar smoke towards one of the quieter corners of the pub . Carol sat alone in a booth , swiveling cubes of ice in what undoubtedly was a glass of scotch . < nl >  Fashionable as ever ,  she noted , raising her glass unenthusiastically at she . < nl >  Well , it 's not like she had time to change ,  she said , looking down at her wrinkly renaissance dress . < nl >  Time , sure .  she pulled out a pack of cigarettes from her chest pocket .  Want a smoke ?  < nl >  Come on , she ,  she said .  You know she do n't smoke , and besides , we 've got important things to do .  < nl >  Important , right .  she said , inhaling deeply .  Ah , that 's the stuff .  < nl >  Why do n't she start by giving she an update ?  < nl > she leaned back , regarding she with an amused look .  Why do n't she start by sitting down for a moment , she ?  < nl > she felt like kicking she . This was why she hated the fifties . she basically turned into a Philip Marlowe with an impossible reluctance to cooperate . < nl >  Fine ,  she said , with a resigned sigh .  Buy she a drink .  < nl >  Buy her own drinks ,  she said , yawning . < nl >  You know , she like she way better in the seventies .  < nl >  It 's the hair , is n't it ?  she said , winking . < nl >  Tell she one thing , she ,  she said , snatching away the cigarette she was just about to light .  If she were one of those dainty women over there - one of those swooning helpless things , without a hint of independence - would she help she if she came running to she ?  < nl >  Swooning , huh ?  she emptied her scotch .  If she remember correctly , back in the 16th century-  < nl >  Yeah , yeah , she could n't handle the corsets , whatever ,  she said , rolling her eyes .  What would it take for she to give she the damn update ?  < nl >  How about she get out of that moldy old dress and get the next round ?  she said , nodding at her empty glass .  she have n't seen those lovely butt cheeks since Leonardo painted Mona .  < nl >  Why did she marry she back in the Antiques , she simply do n't see it ,  she said . < nl >  she think it was the hair .  < nl >  You know , she was going to give she the night of her life , but she guess she 'll have to wait until Zeppelin releases their first album , she mean , it 's only another twenty years .  < nl >  she 'm sure it 'll be worth the wait ,  she said and got up .  Until then there are some swooning ladies by the bar , who appear to be in need of her immediate help .  < nl > she cursed through her teeth and watched she strut over to the dance floor . Be that way , she thought and spun the wheel on her glove again . < eos > 
< sos >  Do you remember when we first met ?  Alice asked , pouring the last of the last bottle . < nl > I smiled .    I was eighteen .   Physics class on the Ohio State campus .  < nl >  Yes ?   Tell she what you first thought .    her dark eyes seemed to swallow all of my peripheral vision like an entire night full of stars on the Mediterranean , centuries before I was born . < nl >  I was stunned .   she were so beautiful and so smart .   she seemed to know her way about the world in every way .   How nature worked .   How people worked .   Like she were ageless .  < nl >  You guessed she from the start !    she laughed . < nl > We had fallen in love and learned about each other .   Loving an immortal turned out to have some complications .   For she , how to keep it fresh ?   she had been alive for more than two millenia and seen it all .   For me , how to not die ?   Turns out a time machine does not make a mortal live any longer . < nl > she had a plan .   A plan given to she by a strange augurer way in her past .   We had no idea of the origin of this plan , but we knew it would work . < nl > After a pause , she asked ,  Tell she where is this Ohio State .  < nl > I described to she a country that would be discovered a thousand years in her future and a culture that could not possibly make sense in any context of this age .   How we studied in the library together and forged this strange bond while working on temporal research .   A young physics prodigy and an immortal of ageless wisdom . < nl >  So ,  I asked she ,  do she remember when we first met ?  < nl >  Of course !  she replied , a great mischief in her eyes .    The great steps of the city of Parsa !  < nl > her eyes grew distant .    she was eighteen .   A thousand years ago , she had no idea she would live so long .   It is still so fresh in her mind .  < nl >  she guess she was persuasive .   Or will be !  < nl >  Oh , she was so rebellious !   To be seduced by a strange foreign man !  < nl > she told me of her unbridled passions , her indignant family and flights in the darkness .   Strange stories of living for ever and taming time as a ship tames the waves . < nl > We had been living here in Cyprus for a year .   We dated each other one year at a stretch , together in the most interesting places on earth , at our whim .   Our year here had drawn to a close and it was time to move on .   There was no packing to be done .   The time machine would move only itself and my naked body . < nl >  Where will I find she ?  I asked she .   This always filled me with dread , but of course she was certain she would find me . < nl >  Alexandria .   At the library .    That mischievous grin .   she and libraries .    Take one month to get there , and then go back exactly 100 years .   Meet she on the day of Mercuralia .  < nl > I just drank in her beauty for a moment .   It would be hard to be away from she for more than a month .   I hoped that she would remember me after a hundred years .   But of course I already knew she would- for me , that year - long date was last year .   And in due course she asked ,  Where shall she find you ?  < nl >  Constantinople .   One hundred years from now .  < nl > her eyes fell .   It was hard for she .   It broke my heart but part of me was reassured that her love endured .   I sometimes wondered if she took lovers in the long intervals , but I really did not care as long as we came back to each other . < nl > We kissed passionately one final time on this island .   But before we parted , she stopped me . < nl >  When you go back to Alexandria .   When you arrive in the past .   Find a sword , first thing .   Even before you find clothes .  < nl > she looked worried .   I must have looked bewildered . < nl >  When we met-- when we meet ...   in the library , she told me to remind she .  < nl > she held me a moment longer . < nl >  It will be alright ,  she added .    Whatever it was , you were unharmed .   But you wanted she to tell you , you will need that sword .  < nl > We parted .   she would live out the next hundred years to meet a slightly younger me in Constantinople .   And I would travel to Alexandria , then hop backwards in time to meet she . < eos > 
< sos >  The government must fall !  Alice shouted , loud and clear . Of course , nobody was listening , but still , she shouted . < nl > Ever since she turned 15 , around four years ago , she developed a hatred for the  corrupt  government . The way they build soldiers for a war , and take money from poor people . The way they force having green energy , though it reduces jobs for the people . The way they make you pay an extra 8 % for everything , just because they * have to * use our money .  Ugh , ca n't they just use the rich people 's money ?  she 'd say . < nl > But , I digress . Armed with nothing but her lucky bow and a single arrow ( seriously , a single arrow ) , she plans to overthrow the government and eventually turn the nation into a communist republic . I do n't even know why she has a bow . It 's not like it 'll do anything significant , other than give someone a small wound . she does n't even have bow training ! And really , could she not build arrows out of a stick , pidgeon feather , sharp pebble , and some duct tape ? I mean , that 's the simplest thing to build . It 's not like she has to smith a sword from scratch , which , even though she ca n't smith to save her life , would still be more effective than a bow and arrow . < nl > Sorry , I go on tangents sometimes . It 's just hard being she * only * friend , and having to help she overthrow the ( perfectly good ) government is annoying . I go to college from Monday thru Friday , and I have a shit - load of homework over the weekend . I do n't have the time to help she  ooh overthrow the government ooh  . The only thing I * can * provide is smithing services , and she already broke the two steel swords I supplied she with . Not only did they take weeks to smith , she said they  just fell apart  . Baloney ! Those swords were my finest work ! Carol said I had the finest blades she 'd ever seen ! < nl > Also , the reason she does n't use a gun , which are legal to carry openly , provided you have a permit , is because they 're  not intimidating enough , duh !  Really ? Not as intimidating as a bow and * single arrow * ? Ooh , I 'm trembling in my tiny sneakers , she . < nl > Anyways , here 's the  valiant tale of our brave hero  she 's forcing me to write . Just know that I 'm exaggarating every detail , okay ? Now , then : < nl > * Our tale begins with she . As a teenager , she had grown to despise the awful , corrupt system . The slimy presidents with their filthy lies , and the treasury that just takes money from innocent people ! They go to war with other nations , build armies to fight , and then ... they try to make peace , as if it never happened . * < nl > * Fed up with this system , she took action . she armed she with her lucky bow and arrow , smithed by her closest friend , and left her home to start the revolution . You see , she loved the martial charm of ancient weapons . A gun would simply not suit she , no matter how powerful . And , she only took one arrow , a symbol of she ... uh ... * < nl > * she took to the streets , gaining loyal followers to her cause . Everyone resented the corrupt system with which they had to deal . she captured their hearts , and their minds , building a small army . * < nl > * At dawn of an unknown day , they struck the White House . The battle between the people , and the system , lasted six days and six nights . But , just before midnight , she pulled a trick - shot with her single arrow , hitting the president in the heart . A perfect shot from she . * < nl > * she took the nation by storm , quickly making she the most loved president in history . she , we salute she . * < nl > Of course , she 's actually going to become a shit leader who just spends all day bragging about how good she is , but that 's between you and I. < nl > * * * * * < nl > * Creative criticism appreciated .

< sos > They came for Alice at dawn , screaming across the dusty plain , throwing up a choking cloud in their wake which turned the sun red . she knew this was an entirely dramatic decision , since Carol 'd set up camp sometime the afternoon before . Within sight of the city 's towers . < nl > The gates and walls of Newhaven were more than strong enough to keep them out , but that was n't what she wanted . her men had their orders , all civilians had been evacuated to the bunkers . They were ready . she was ready for her audience . < nl > They burst through the gate , apparently not even registering how easy it all was . Either they were too used to attacking the smaller settlements and steads around Newhaven , or this was their first raid . Either way , it was going to be their last . It was n't every day the bandits actually presented themselves to you , after all . < nl > she took an astonishly long time to reach she , though she deliberately stayed in her office . she must have stopped for a rousing speech or two along the way . she stood wearily as she burst through the door , bow at the ready , dark hair flying dramatically . Only her closest lieutenants were with she , each similarly armed with longbows , crossbows and swords . < nl >  Hello , * she * !  she spat , tossing her head . < nl >  she .  she said , sighing inwardly .  Glad she 're home safe .  < nl >  she 've returned !  she said , in what she obviously believed was a fierce , rabble - rousing voice . In reality , she just sounded like a sixteen - year - old girl having a temper tantrum . < nl >  she see that .  < nl >  she 've returned ,  she repeated , her eyes flashing ,  to free the people from the yoke of their cruel tyrant ! she 've returned , she , so that we can rebuild society as something good for all , so that her child will never know a world of oppression , indecency , and indignity !  < nl > At that she threw a look at Jaime , Tom Brandon 's eldest boy , who was stood right behind she . It was obviously meant to be a meaningful glance , or maybe a longing one . Instead they both just looked a bit constipated . The pause gave she a chance to process what she 'd said , however . she slapped a hand over her face , groaning . < nl >  Fuck 's sake , she , she 're pregnant too ?  < nl >  This is n't about who she choose to love !  she cried dramatically , her face turning red as a bead of sweat began to trickle from her hairline .  This is about ...  < nl >  It 's about she grounding she ,  she said sharply , dropping her hand . she gestured , and her men came forward , rifles at the ready . her followers looked uncertain now .  It 's about she thinking we love Hannah more . What this is about , she , is Elva . she 's what this is about .  < nl >  she did n't join the bandits !  she yelled . That attempt at a revolutionary tone had vanished now . she stamped her foot .  They 're temporary * allies * . she 'll reward them when she take over , so ...  < nl >  They came with she because they thought they 'd get to pillage the city while she were up here .  she said , deliberately staying calm .  Do n't worry , she 'll deal with them . Kids , you hand your weapons over to her men now . Your parents have been worried sick about you all .  < nl > The other kids , staring down the barrels of actual guns with the crackle of gunfire outside , handed over their gear willingly . One , a girl who could n't have been older than twelve , started to cry . she stamped her foot again and shrieked wordlessly . < nl >  You always have to ruin * everything * !  she screamed ,  she 'm going to take over the city and free everyone from slavery , and * you ca n't stop she * !  < nl >  she , no one here 's a slave . This is the only truly safe place for half a continent . People are happy to be here . she 've been out there now , she 've see . That , have n't she ? Anyway , she 'll get her chance to lead when she retire ...  < nl >  she 'm not waiting until then ! she 're a monster !  < nl > she loosed the arrow - the look on her face suggested she had n't meant to do it , or maybe that she was surprised she had dared too . The arrow flew surprisingly true ( she must have been practicing ) and lodged in her vest . she took half a step back , bumping into the desk , and let out an irritated grunt . Before she could do anything else there was a deafening report , followed by a heavy thud . < nl > she looked down at she , horrified . Then she rolled over , pressed a hand to the exit wound just above her hip ( which was , thankfully , oozing rather than gushing ) and began to weep hysterically . < nl >  she ! she shot she , she let she shoot she !  < nl > she sighed heavily .  Dave , take the others to the station , contact their parents . Henry , ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD take her she to Doctor Jennings , please ? And Gary ,  she looked at she ,  please do n't do that again .  < eos > 
< sos >  Come !  The paw on the back of Alice's head scratches through her fur . she snap at Carol . she still treats she like a pup , and she is old . Old or not , she manages to catch she and roll she over . she bat at her chest and she snaps and growls near her ears until she surrender . < nl >  Insolent pup ,  she growls again as she lets she up . < nl >  she 'm not a pup !  she stand up and shake .  she have earned her name . Elva gave she a name !  < nl >  she ! Sapphire !  her voice from inside makes she perk up her ears . < nl >  she calls again . Come !  she turns back toward the house and trots over . she follow , and playfully snap at her golden tail . she ignores she because she am obeying . < nl > she opens the door . she Not quite 100 years yet . she just came of age last week , and there was a big celebration . she was quite popular that night , as her friends gave she many treats . There was talk among the adults about she going away . she said she would go with she , and that made she happy . she wag her tail at she . she pats her head , but then she kneels down and hugs she . she is crying . < nl >  What 's wrong ?  she ask she . she only reaches out and pats her head again . she does n't understand she yet . Not like ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD knows what we say . ProtagonistD understands she more easily . And then she notice that she is not wagging her tail . she is also sad . < nl >  she ?  she demand . she muscle her way into the hug and lick her face . she laughs a little .  she , what 's wrong ?  < nl >  she have to go see ProtagonistD ,  she says . she breaks away from the hug and leaves she with she . she sniff she . she smells of the chemicals that Master smells like all the time now . she listen . she can hear she talking , talking to ProtagonistE . she she out of the hug to follow she , up the stairs , up to ProtagonistD's room . < nl >  Hey she ,  says she when she enter . she rubs she behind the ears the way she like . she tell she thank she . < nl >  she ,  says ProtagonistE . she greet ProtagonistE and ProtagonistE pets she . ProtagonistE seems all right , but for the odd smell . < nl >  she belongs to she .  her voice sounds odd , like she is in distress , but she smell no danger . < nl >  Ah .  ProtagonistE is packing up .  If she need anything else ...  < nl >  Thank ProtagonistE .  she walks out with ProtagonistE . < nl > she is on the bed . she lays her head on ProtagonistD's chest , who looks asleep . The chemicals make she want to sneeze , but she had told she that is disrespectful . There 's another smell too : it 's been present for a long time , but today it is stronger than before . < nl > she walk up to the side of the bed .  she !  she speak loudly to get her attention . < nl > she opens her big brown eyes .  Quiet , she ,  she says .  And go away .  < nl >  No ! Tell she what is going on . Why does ProtagonistD smell like this ? Why is she crying ?  she put her paws on the bed to look at ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD's skin is very sallow and thin . The veins stand out . < nl >  she am the Seventh ,  says she . she lifts her head from ProtagonistD's chest .  her family was made part of ProtagonistD's family generations ago , when she was just a pup .  she looks at ProtagonistD's face .  ProtagonistF was named Dodger as well . ProtagonistF named she , knowing she would be the last .  < nl >  The last ?  she whine .  she , what are she talking about ?  < nl > she sighs .  she 're too young to understand .  < nl >  she am not a puppy !  she say it loudly .  she am not !  < nl > ProtagonistD opens her eyes , and she wonder if she have made a mistake . But she laughs and reaches out to scratch her ears . Like she , she knows how to scratch properly . < nl >  Hullo , she ,  she says . she wag her tail .  Be a good dog for Jenny , mm ?  < nl >  she will ,  she tell she . she feel she looking at she , all solemn . < nl >  she ,  says ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistD do n't have long before ProtagonistD go . she will take care of ProtagonistD .  < nl > she hear a car pull up the driveway outside . It 's a large one . she run to the window and look out : it 's big and white , and strange humans in uniform get out . she begins to talk with them . she run back to the bed . < nl > she look at she .  she ca n't leave . she ca n't leave !  she whine . < nl >  Hey , hey ,  says ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD catches she near the ears again , gently .  ProtagonistD told she , she will take care of ProtagonistD .  < nl > she whine at them both .  You ca n't leave !  < nl > The men come upstairs with a bed on wheels . she comes with them and takes she aside . < nl >  Got ta move she .  < nl >  she 'll move she ,  says she . she lifts she off the bed . she seems older than she did a little while ago . she whine at she , but she just holds she and cries . < nl >  she ca n't leave !  she tell she , but she does n't understand yet .  They wo n't bring she back !  < nl > But she does leave . she just holds she and weeps while the vehicles drive away . < nl > We go downstairs and outside . she walks down the driveway , following the vehicles . < nl >  she , wait !  she strain against her hands . she calls for she , and she waits a moment . she get free . < nl >  she , we have to bring ProtagonistD back !  she tell she . she could still hear the vehicles on the road . she was running up behind she . < nl > she wags her tail at she .  ProtagonistD told she to be a good dog and take care of she . Be good , she .  she licks her face and runs off , golden fur shining in the sunlight . she holds onto she and calls for she , but she disobeys . she had never seen she disobey before . she had never called she by her name before . < nl > she only saw she one more time : we found she at the meadow where ProtagonistD's body was laid , curled against the crossed stone that marked it . < nl > she was the Seventh of her family . she am the First of she . < nl > --- < nl > * Wow , she 'm overwhelmed by all the feedback and the comments . she 'm so glad so many people enjoyed this ! * < eos > 
< sos > Moreover , the  flowers  are wrapped in sheets produced from the ground , reconstituted , and subsequently desiccated flesh of their cousins ,  trees .  < nl > It is usually the male who presents this gift to Alice , and she must first react with a loud cry , to express horror at the evidence of slaughter . This is to demonstrate that she is not bloodthirsty , and will not eat their young . < nl > If she is receptive to the male 's advances , she will then accept the corpses , and display the bodies until they shrivel and mummify , at which point they are no longer attractive to she , and will be removed . she will keep these corpses as long as possible , for the aroma of their decaying tissues is pleasing to she , and , indeed , this species has been known to mate in the torn limbs of  flowers ,  known as  petals ,  in the chamber that they retire to , following their bonding ceremony , called a  honeymoon suite .  < nl > If she is not receptive to the male 's advances , she will still accept them . However , rather than keep them to the point of mummification , she will bring the fresh corpses with she to her  office ,  where she competes with other members of her species to see who can remain for the longest period of time in front of a  monitor .  A  monitor  in the  office  is a light emitting device that causes pain , and therefore functions as a litmus test for which individuals have the greatest toughness , and fitness for survival . The goal is to attain such great lengths of exposure in this setting that they permanently destroy their capacity to feel , and thereby transcend the limits of pain . < nl > In any case , she will display the corpses in the  office  to demonstrate to others that she is so desired that she can afford to throw away the corpses pre - maturely , without striving to keep their aroma . This is a part of something called  office politics ,  which we will discuss in the next chapter . < eos > 
< sos > It turned the sheerest blonde hair into midnight black . Alice tested it on she - it did n't budge , not even when she deliberately muttered something mildly forgetful , that should have sent tendrils of blonde creeping back . < nl > As she stared in the mirror , she knew what * could * happen if she were to market this widely . People would go rabid over this stuff . she could charge them ludicrous sums of money , and they 'd still buy it . she could be a billionaire by the month 's end . Few people had completely black hair , unless they chose to never say anything . It simply happened to everyone : you made a dumb comment , or forgot something obvious - and the blonde streaks appeared . < nl > And then there were those born blonde . < nl > she turned from the mirror and approached the bedroom . Carol was still lying in the same spot , staring listlessly at the ceiling . her hair was swept in careless blonde waves around she . < nl >  It worked ,  she said quietly , and put the bottle on the table . < nl > she looked at it , and a spark of life entered her eyes . she 'd watched she work on it for months , but had never really thought it would work . It was a sweet gesture - she trying to work on a solution for the problem that had crippled her entire life . But it could n't * really * work . < nl >  It turns her hair ... black ?  she said , so softly she had to ask she to repeat she . < nl > she leaned over and kissed she .  Pitch black . Now , please , go dye it . And go to the interview . Please .  < nl > her face crumbled and she turned away from she . Like all born - blondes , she had never been given a chance . she 'd fought her way through university , to prove she was n't stupid . Some of her professors had cheered and patted themselves on the back for being progressive enough to allow a born - blonde in the classroom . < nl > Pretending it mattered , that society was progressing beyond its prejudices . An empty gesture , in the end . No - one trusted that she could do the job , even with her degree . she was , quite simply , blonde . The brilliance she saw every day , the edge of her humour and mind , did n't matter . No - one 's hair turned black from moments of cleverness . < nl >  Dye it ,  she whispered .  Please . Just dye it , and go out . Try one more time , for she .  < nl > she took a deep breath , and finally nodded . she heaved she up and grabbed the bottle to disappear into the bathroom . she heard the sound of running water . When she emerged , her hair was a sleek and shiny black . she smiled tremulously at she in the mirror , and ran her fingers through it . < nl >  she should share it ,  she said .  she should give it out to everyone . For free . Stop this from happening to anyone else .  < nl > she saw again the countless faces of those who jeered at Elva on the street , who refused to listen to a word she said , just on principle . The people who nudged each other and stifled grins when she tried to make a point . The people who had allowed she to fade to this shadow of she . < nl >  she will ,  she promised .  But once everyone has black hair , it wo n't matter . she just want she to get a little revenge , first . she want she to go out there and listen as they beg she to work for them . Please - go kick ass now .  < nl > she tied her hair up , and she thought she saw a glimmer of her she in the set of her mouth and eyes . < nl > she turned to kiss she . < nl >  Just be she , ok ?  she said , and hugged she close . < nl > -------------- < nl > Hope you enjoyed my story ! You can find more of my work on /r / Inkfinger/. < eos > 
< sos >  We have it , sir .  < nl >  Excellent ,  I said ,  now hurry up and put Alice in the interrogation chamber .  < nl >  Sir !  Carol rushed to comply and hoisted she , and tied she to a chair . < nl >  Make sure her binds are secured ,  I told she ,  we do n't want she getting free .  < nl > I sat across from she , I wanted she to see me when she first regained consciousness , to know that her life was over . < nl > I did n't have to wait long . Soon she stirred , and reflexively strained against her bonds . I stiffened for a second , but she gave up , unable to break free . I let out a shaky breath that I did n't even realize I had been holding . < nl > Soon she opened her sharp blue eyes suddenly and looked right at me . To her credit , she did n't flinch . < nl > I gave she a smile . < nl >  So she , is it ?  I said , savoring the moment ,  welcome to hell .  < nl > her eyes flickered about , taking in the sights , my red skin , pointy tail , my horns . The temperature , which humans find uncomfortable apparently , and the sharp odor of brimstone . And just for a moment her cool facade slipped , a crack in her mask , and her eyes widened slightly , her lips parted . < nl > And then it was gone as swiftly as it had come . But I saw it , I saw her fear . It felt good to know that her leader could feel it . < nl > she looked at me again , with that same intense gaze that commanded authority , it was no wonder she became the leader of the Earth Congress .  It 's a little warm ,  she said , actually managing to smile ,  and these bonds are a bit too tight , do you mind loosening them ?  < nl > I laughed mirthlessly , the laughter not reaching my eyes . Laughed at the courage of she , her ability to make jokes , to retain some semblance of control despite her situation . Laughed at our final victory . < nl >  I see through her facade , she , talk all she want , she 'll be doing a lot of that whether she want it or not soon enough . You know this not a welcoming party .  < nl >  So ,  she said , leaning back and managing to look as comfortable as possible in her bonds ,  let 's skip the part where she refuse to tell you her plans , and you scare and intimidate she , and then you torture she so much that she eventually give in and tell you everything anyways , just that time without her fingers .  < nl >  Let 's start simply then ,  I said , slightly uncomfortable by her forthright manner ,  how did you invade hell ?  We already knew the answer to this , and we suspected the humans did not know that we knew . I wanted to test her honesty . < nl > she shrugged .  It was simple really , we managed to reverse engineer-  I held up my hand . < nl >  I 'm sorry , reverse engineer ?  I asked , not knowing the phrase . < nl >  To build something by looking at a complete version ,  she explained . I motioned for she to continue . she nodded ,  Yes ... reverse engineer one of your imp nests that spawned imps from hell directly to Earth , and managed to make a device that does the opposite . This also gave us the space - time co - ordinates of hell , so we knew where and when to go .  < nl > I pretended to frown , as if thinking if this would work , but my mind was racing . she was telling the truth , we had lost an imp nest and we had figured that 's how the humans had made their way back in . < nl >  Alright , let 's continue . Where will the human forces be retreating ?  < nl > she pretended to look confused ,  she 'm sorry , what do you mean retreat ?  < nl > I smiled savagely .  Do she take us for fools , she ? she think we would infiltrate the very heart of her planet and capture she just to ask questions ? No , she know as well as we do that we have cut off the head of the snake , without she the humans will halt their offensive .  < nl > And what an offensive it had been . In the first months of 2021 we had pushed the humans back , taking their cities and killing their people . But after the surprise had faded the humans had pushed back . * Hard * . Their ... technology let them perform wonders that we thought they were incapable of . We could launch fireballs but they could shoot iron balls from some sort of hand held device . We had demons with wings , but they flew in metal birds . We had leviathans in the oceans but they had steel titans that sailed * on * the oceans . < nl > We were pushed back , and had retreated to hell after extensive casualties . We thought we would lick our wounds , bide our time , strike when the humans were weak , when we became a myth once again . We had the patience for millennia after all . < nl > But then they came to us . < nl > They tore into us , like insects they marched across the planes of oblivion , destroying our structures , freeing our prisoners . They recruited long dead humans , the most vicious of them , and turned them against us . They had marched to the palace of hell itself , seeking to capture Elva .   Without she we would fall apart , the different species of demons would turn on each other , and the war would be over . < nl > But that had not happened . And I turned back to she gloating ,  Just as we can not fight without she , her humans will crumble without she . They are finished .  < nl > her face had paled , and I bore on ,  do n't worry though , we will not kill she , we will keep she alive for a * long * time , before her release comes and she go to heaven , longer that she would have lived on Earth .  I paused dramatically , savoring the look of utter fear on her face ,    Of course she might not find it as ... comfortable as Earth .  < nl > I had expected she to cower , to cry , perhaps even revert back to her stoic mask , not showing emotions . < nl > I did not expect she to laugh . < nl >  You fools , you sorry , poor fools !  she said , gasping for breath .  she .. she just could n't keep up the act anymore , my God .  I flinched as she said the last word , but remained confused . < nl >  I was told she did n't understand human psychology , but delusion of this scale I had not even imagined .  she was actually crying from laughter , and now * she * smiled smugly at me .  she have a second , you idiot , she will be replaced and the humans will continue attacking . This is not some sort of movie where if you kill the leader , all the underlings fall apart . Killing she does nothing .  < nl > I sat back , stunned . she had been acting , pretending to be afraid , pretending to show her ' true ' emotions . And the human assault would not stop .  she lie !  I screamed at she ,  all species ' fall without their leader . she kill a pack leader and she become leader , she kill the Devil and the demons fall apart . This is the nature of the world !  < nl > she just continued laughing . < nl > The Devil needed to be evacuated ! The humans may not need she but we did . I turned to shout orders to the soldiers outside , and they hurried away , reporting to the Devil . < nl > I turned back to she .  her humans may advance , but she will not , we captured she , and rest assured she will not see the light of day again .  < nl > she stopped laughing and smiled at me . A smile that chilled me to the bone .  What the hell makes you think you were capable enough to capture she ... if we did n't let you .  < nl > she returned , one of the human hand devices in her hand , and pointed it at me . < nl >  Betrayal ,  I whispered . Then , fiercely , I turned to she ,  Traitor !  < nl > she shrugged , untying her bonds .  she like to be on the winning side .  < nl > she turned to me .  Thank you for bringing she to the most secure location in hell . The tracker she have swallowed has alerted her forces where this is . We will release the most fearsome humans in history from this facility .  < nl > she turned to walk away .  Kill it ,  she said in a dismissive gesture ,  we have work to do .  < nl >  Sorry boss ,  she said with a casual shrug , and shot me . < nl > Blackness ensued . < nl > * * * < nl > ( minor edits ) < nl > If you enjoyed , check out my new subreddit [ XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com / r / XcessiveWriting/ ) < nl > * * Due to popular demand , I present to you , [ Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/5hk0nq / wp_2021_hell_invades_earth_2022_earth_invades_hell / db1got6/ ) * * < nl > EDIT : /u / YouWriteITalk was kind enough to narrate this story .

< sos > Alice knocked on the door of a small , dilapidated cabin in the woods . It was a dreary day , with clouds that blanketed the sky and hung low to the Earth . she saw Carol part the curtains in the window of the little shack as a breeze whipped up and blew her silver hair around her face . The door opened a few inches . < nl >  Have she got the silver ?  Elva growled from inside . she extended a small leather pouch toward the door . From the inside she could hear several children crying .  Get back !  she snarled to someone inside ,  This does n't concern you !  she snatched the purse from her hand and opened the door fully . she pointed to ProtagonistD . Even caked with mire and soot , she could tell ProtagonistD was a beautiful creature . she started to smile a toothy grin , wrinkles hoisted up around her eyes . < nl > she was 12 thousand years old , and while she could change her appearance at will , she chose to walk the earth in her true form : hobbled , hunched , wrinkled and warted . ProtagonistD let out a piercing scream , as they often did . she yelled louder ,  QUIET  . ProtagonistD stopped screaming , but ProtagonistD's mouth still hung open . < nl > she looked around the room .  First she 'll need permission from both the mother and she to enter . Then she can take ProtagonistD by the hand and we 'll be on our way .   Mother 's dead ,  she said flatly .  Why else do she think she 're here ? she can hardly take care of any of them .  Three other children sat clutching one another on a bed , faces all ruddy with dirt .  Ah . she see . she 'll just need yours then ,  replied she .  Come on then . Get it over with .  < nl > ProtagonistD looked at she in horror and began to sob , throwing ProtagonistD on the floor . she stepped into the room and past the other children . she knelt down beside ProtagonistD , put a hand on ProtagonistD's back and looked up at she .  What 's ProtagonistD's name ?  she asked .  Lilith ,  she said , staring at the door .  Lilith ,  she whispered to ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD buried ProtagonistD's face in the crook of ProtagonistD's arm , still crying on the floor .  ProtagonistD , can she show ProtagonistD something ? she think ProtagonistD 'll like it .  ProtagonistD peeked one eye above ProtagonistD's arm .  Good ,  she said warmly . she then sat all the way on the floor , next to ProtagonistD and produced from inside the sleeve of her robe , ProtagonistE . ProtagonistD looked up from her arm completely now . ProtagonistE was the most beautiful golden house sparrow . ProtagonistE sat in her palm and radiated light and warmth . ProtagonistD sat up now and looked on at ProtagonistE at eye level . ProtagonistE hopped about in her hand and began to sing .   Is that , real ?  ProtagonistD asked timidly .  Oh , everything is real , ProtagonistD . Everything ProtagonistD can think of .  she said . Would ProtagonistD like to see something else ?  Okay ,  ProtagonistD mumbled . she laid one finger on the top of ProtagonistE's head and immediately it was turned to solid gold . A golden chain slithered through the air , appearing one link at a time , and joined with ProtagonistE . she held up a radiant gold necklace . ProtagonistD gasped ,  Did she kill ProtagonistE ? Is ProtagonistE dead ?  she laughed ,  Oh no . she can turn ProtagonistE back anytime she like .  she paused ,  And so can ProtagonistD . Would ProtagonistD like to try ?  ProtagonistD outstretched ProtagonistD's hand and grasped the necklace . It was warm to the touch , ProtagonistD thought ProtagonistD could almost feel it pulsing .  Just tap ProtagonistE with ProtagonistD's index finger on the top of ProtagonistE's head , and imagine ProtagonistE 's a bird again . It 's that simple . Go on .  < nl > All of the other children and she were watching on with mouths agape . ProtagonistD held ProtagonistE in ProtagonistD's hand and tapped ProtagonistE gently on the head . ProtagonistE immediately sprung to life and flitted around the room . ProtagonistD shrieked with delight , ProtagonistD's former sorrow nowhere to be found . she laughed and clapped her hands ,  she knew it ! she 've felt it for a long while now , in these woods , and it was ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistD looked puzzled ,  What do she mean ?   Ah , nevermind for now . There 's plenty of time for that later ,  she said .  ProtagonistE's name is Oscen . ProtagonistE is ProtagonistD and will come whenever ProtagonistD breathe ProtagonistE's name .   Oscen !  ProtagonistD called . A streak of gold flashed across the ceiling and landed on ProtagonistD's head . ProtagonistE chittered happily and played with pieces of ProtagonistD's hair .  Ha ! You see ! That 's perfect .  she reached to put a finger under ProtagonistE's belly . ProtagonistE hopped onto her hand and she placed it on ProtagonistD's shoulder .  ProtagonistD beamed and tried to look at ProtagonistE . < nl >  Now ProtagonistD ,  she said quietly .  she have a great many things to tell ProtagonistD , but ProtagonistD 'll have to come with she .  ProtagonistD looked around the room . Everyone looked on completely bewildered .  I want to go ,  a voice squeaked from the bed . ProtagonistF hit the girl that spoke up .  Shut up !  ProtagonistF hissed .  Can ProtagonistG come with ProtagonistD ?  ProtagonistD asked she quietly .  No ,  she answered .  she 'm afraid she is right . ProtagonistD see , ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD 're special . she could bring ProtagonistG , but ProtagonistG would not be able to learn and do the things that ProtagonistD could . It would be cruel ,  replied she . < nl > ProtagonistD was quiet for a moment and held ProtagonistE in ProtagonistD's palm .  Will ProtagonistD do more of this ?   It does n't matter what ProtagonistD do , ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD 've been paid for . ProtagonistD have to leave !  she bellowed . she sprang up from the floor with a peculiar spryness for a woman her age and shouted ,  That is quite enough !  and pinched her fingers together . she yelled back but no sound came out . she stopped and looked wide eyed at she . Suddenly she bolted toward she and reached her arms out in an effort to throttle her neck . she threw her hands up in front of her face to protect she . she was caught off guard and braced for contact , but it never came . she looked up at she and she had simply frozen in place . her entire body , save for her eyes racing around the room , was completely still . The children , while not paralyzed , were completely quiet , stricken with fear . she looked over at ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD was standing feet apart , staring at she with clutched fists , ProtagonistE still on ProtagonistD's shoulder . she slowly walked up to ProtagonistD and lay a hand on ProtagonistD's arm . she was shaking and a tear streamed down her cheek .  ProtagonistD ,  she said softly .  ProtagonistD take her hand and let 's go . she think ProtagonistD know now , and probably have always known that ProtagonistD were n't meant to be here . Come with she .  < nl > ProtagonistD softened and looked at she . After a moment ProtagonistD placed her small hand in her . They walked toward the door .  Hey !  she yelled ,  she ca n't leave she like that ! she have to fix she ! ProtagonistD !   she 'll be fine .  she said coldly and opened the door , still clasping ProtagonistD's hand . The two walked outside and let the door close behind them . Remarkably , the sky had completely cleared , revealing the most beautiful shade of azure the two had ever seen . < nl > * Edit : There are two more sections floating around here somewhere . Thank you everyone for your kind words . For fans of she , take heart . We 'll get there . < nl > * Double Edit :   If you would like to keep going on this adventure , she started a Tumblr ( lol ) [ which can be found here](http://eternizemecaptain.tumblr.com / post/155532294120 / part-5 ) . < nl > You guys are seriously awesome . she posted the last part that she 'll post on this thread somewhere below . If you want to keep up with the stories , she would love to keep hearing your thoughts ! Thanks everyone ! < eos > 
< sos > We 've tied Alice to a railing on the catwalk over the Void of Lost Remembrance . she does not cry , though I 'd prefer that she did . Instead , she twists loosely in the breeze , trying , trying to understand what we 've done . < nl >  They have families ,  she says .  Do n't you care at least about the families they left behind ?  < nl > We close the door and leave she there , so we no longer have to listen . In all this time , in all these years , she has never gotten better . she is always looking outward , towards people and places and things that are not us , and worries about * them * and * their happiness * . she can not understand why that does n't matter . We can not convince she . < nl > So she will twist over the chasm for a time . And we will go back to work . < nl > ProtagonistE is working the controls , alone , as usual . We watch as the Husk glides through white and green halls , thin carpet stretched over cement , closed doors on either side . The Husk knocks twice on one door that is entirely like all the rest , and Carol says ,  Come in .  < nl > she is a pretty woman , black bun'd hair , wire glasses , sitting in the valley between two teetering stacks of binders . < nl >  This case , right ?  she says , smiling , playfully straightening one of the mounds .  After all this , she hope he 's not actually guilty .  < nl > Elva spits on the screen .  Whore !  she shouts .  Why does she talk to us like that ? Like we 're the same ? Like we 're equals ?  < nl > Patience is there , though , putting a small hand on the rough hide of her scaly back .  There there . In time , in time . she 'll see . Just give it a bit .  < nl > ProtagonistD has wings , and ProtagonistD flies about the chamber , dragging ProtagonistD small , fairy feet across the top of her head .  You hear that , buddy ? We 'll get ' er ! Oh yeah , we will ! We 'll cut she up ! Up up * up * !  Dancing on the console , ProtagonistD starts counting on ProtagonistD's pink , dusty fingers .  We 'll cut out her heart , and her lungs , and her kidneys , then the liver , then her uterus - that 's ProtagonistD's very very favorite ! - and then all those intestines and then ...  < nl >  Knock it off !  growls ProtagonistE , shooing ProtagonistD away .  ProtagonistE ca n't see what ProtagonistE 'm doing .  < nl >  ProtagonistE alright , ProtagonistE ?  says she , she face a veil of concern , false and womanly .  ProtagonistE look far away .  < nl >  Oh ,  says the Husk , and I see ProtagonistE flick the switch , turn on that sly smirk .  ProtagonistE get a little lost when ProtagonistE 'm around she .  < nl > she sighs , almost in spite of she . ProtagonistE sits up straight , leaning slightly back . ProtagonistE 's satisfied . They all are . And it 's in these moments - these pivotal points , where everything begins coming into alignment and the wheels start picking up momentum - it 's always in these moments when they all turn to look at me . To see what I 'll say , or if I 'll say anything at all . < nl >  It 's good , is n't it , Remorse ?  says Excitement , fluttering before me .  We got another one !  < nl > And I smile . And shrug . As I always do .  Looks like it .  < eos > 
< sos >  Alice ,  said Carol to she ,  It is time for us to leave .  < nl > her face went pale and her eyes began to well .  Not now , please ,  she whispered . * Begged * .  Not now .  < nl >  It is her time she ,  she answered . her deep voice ran like a cold chill through her bones . Tears trickled down her cheeks ; she placed her hands over her stomach protectively . < nl >  her waters burst ,  she said , more to she than to she ,  Elva 's coming .  < nl > she looked at her swollen stomach and then at the puddle on the floor . A part of she she 'd thought long since dead began to awake . For the first time in her existence , she doubted . < nl >  she 'm sorry , she , but there can be no exceptions .  she raised an arm and pointed a long , bony finger towards she . An ancient golden ring adorned it .  she must come with she .  < nl >  Please . she will come freely after , but * please * - do n't take she . she 's not even lived , yet . * Please . *  < nl > her outstretched arm trembled . < nl >  she take life , not give it ,  said she , but her voice trembled in doubt , just as her arm . < nl > she doubled over in pain , then fell back , sliding down against the wall .  ProtagonistD ,  she said through clenched teeth .  That 's her name . Ellie .  < nl > she lowered her head . she had thought the part of she that had once been human had long since rotted away . But she had been wrong . While * she * had been festering , * she * had been waiting for a moment like this . < nl >  If she help she , she will no longer ...  her voice trailed off , and whatever thought she had was quickly banished . < nl > she leaned down and gently picked she up . she carried she to her bed ; she yelled out in pain as sweat mingled indistinguishably with tears . she gently lay she down , before removing her dark robe and placing it over she . she tucked a pillow underneath her head , and went to the kitchen to get a wet cloth . < nl > When she returned , she was holding out a hand ; she tenderly took it in she . she squeezed her hand tightly all the while . < nl > Hours passed , but eventually ProtagonistD's crown poked out and she helped deliver ProtagonistD into the world . she held ProtagonistD for a moment longer than necessary , before passing ProtagonistD over to she . < nl > she kissed ProtagonistD on the forehead and smiled through the tears . If she had been able to look away from ProtagonistD , she might have caught she briefly smiling , too . < nl > --- < nl > It was ProtagonistE who found ProtagonistD late that evening . ProtagonistE had let ProtagonistE in after no one had answered the bell . ProtagonistE 'd found she wrapped in a large black rag , next to her body . An ancient , golden ring lay besides them . < nl > ProtagonistF said she had been dead for some hours - a rupture , ProtagonistF called it . But ProtagonistE knew that could n't have been the case - she * could n't * have been dead that long . she had been happy and content when ProtagonistE 'd found she . And , ProtagonistE suspected , recently fed . ProtagonistE was sure she 'd been cared for all the way up until she 'd been found . < nl > --- < nl > More of my stories on : /r / nickofnight ( next ten subs get free mug : c [ ] ) < nl > Thanks for the great prompt ! < eos > 
< sos > The final test was administered by Alice . she strode into the interrogation room , carrying what appeared to be an intricate , mechanical chess board , thick and heavy . < nl > From the other side of the one - way mirrors , Carol felt scores of eyes burn into her back . < nl >  This is not normal chess , she ,  she said , pointedly , as the chess board automatically unfolded to about six times the usual size of one , covering the entire table .  It 's a variation , a hundred times more complex , and she 'll be playing against a computer program specifically written for this occasion .  < nl > An airy , melodious tone issued as the board lit up , thrumming as hologram pieces filled the playing field . The opposing sides populated first , then both sides , then finally the middle , leaving a moat of empty spaces , and giving she the impression of a towering castle besieged by relentless invaders . < nl >  Do she want to know the rules ?  < nl >  Er ,  she said , well aware of how tiny her voice sounded then ,  that would be good . she do n't even know which pieces are she or what they do .  < nl > she scoffed , then tossed a sheaf of papers her way .  Amuse she with the rulebook then . Suffice to say , this game has been designed to eliminate chance and randomness entirely - there is no way you can possibly win through luck . Only an in - depth knowledge of the game 's engine , and a masterful application of skill , can carry you through . All the best .  < nl > Another beep from the board , and she saw the AI take its opening move , sliding a hologram piece from PF72 to XA25 . A countdown timer hung in the air , giving she only 3 minutes to complete her counterstroke . < nl > The game was on . < nl > she ca n't explain exactly how her powers work . she suspect maybe if she really put her mind to it , she could , but then she 'd only be able to do it once , so she better have a camera rolling when she did it . < nl > Because that was the key limitation in place . she could attempt anything , and no matter how foreign or alien the activity , she would succeed - but only for the first time . Thereafter , her powers would flee she , and whether or not she would ever succeed again depended only on her own efforts , her own skills . < nl > she 've had an interesting life for sure . her parents tell she she managed to feed she perfectly when she was one , manipulating her cutlery like a seasoned chef with a lifetime of experience . After that , it was mess after mess after mess , until she finally acquired the necessary hand - eye coordination at the ripe age of six . < nl > It was the same for everything else . The first time she tried her hand at writing a song , it became an instant pop hit , blitzing down the charts like Taylor Swift on speed . The next limerick was universally rejected , deemed more offensive than a dog 's fart . The same familiar cycle ensued for when she tried driving , kiteflying , speaking Russian , dancing ... it was the same blessing , the same curse , everytime . < nl >  Impossible !  yelled she , ashen - faced , staring at the board as it beeped continuously , signalling some sort of end - state . The board , which had started with an equal number of blue and red pieces , now ran rampant with blue pawns , with only a smattering of red here and there . The timer had changed to indicate that the AI and she had exchanged a total of 520 moves each . < nl > she sat back in her chair , still not fully aware of what she had done . Sure , she had moved a couple of pieces around , but only when it felt right , you know ? < nl >  Fine , she accept that she does indeed have powers beyond her comprehension ,  she growled as she skulked to the door , wresting it open sourly .  she 's suited to her mission then .  < nl > Elva entered , the sharpness of her black suit suggesting a certain preciseness which underpinned the way she led her life . < nl >  she 'm the Director of the CIA ,  she said , extending a vise of a handshake .  she are eminently suited for a mission of utmost importance to our great nation . If she accept it , she will single - handedly help break the deadlock which has gripped the world , and perhaps restore a modicum of peace .  < nl >  she will try her best , she . So tell she , who is it that she need assassinated ?  < nl > she laughed perfunctorily .  Who said anything about killing ? No , her mission is harder than that . We need she to infiltrate the FSB . she will undo them from within .  < nl > The lump in her throat tightened , and she could not swallow it away .  she , she can probably infiltrate the FSB on her first try , but after that ... she 'll have to prepare she adequately , otherwise there is no way she can continue to assist .  < nl >  Of course ! Come this way , she will have unfettered access to every resource the CIA has . This country will do all that it can to prepare she for her mission .  < nl > --- < nl > That night , as she lay in bed , thoroughly exhausted from all the hothousing the CIA had put she through , she counted the seconds in her head , waiting patiently . < nl > When she heard the clock strike three from the hallway , she slipped out of bed , then picked out an old copy of * Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy * from her bookshelf , eased an ear plug from a hollowed space within , and slipped it on . < nl >  They 've accepted she ,  she said , her hushed tones evaporating like gossamer webbings the moment she released them into the air . < nl >  Very good , she ,  came the reply .  And on the first try too , like she promised .  < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos >  Alice 'm getting really fucking sick of this !  she shouted at Carol , working quickly to untie the ropes that held her hands behind her back . < nl >  Yeah , well she wish she never had to show up either . But here we are again .  she kept an eye on the door to her interrogation room , waiting for the foreign agents to return . < nl > After gnawing on a particularly tight section of rope , she spat .  Ca n't she get a more relaxing job ? Like in an office ? she could just show up to help get the printer working or something like that .  < nl >  she , you know this has been her life 's ambition .  < nl >  But it is n't she . she 've dragged she along for this whole ride , working her way towards the top of the heap . she think she LIKE that she was cursed .  < nl > she rolled her eyes , but said nothing . her bonds fell to the ground . As she rubbed her wrists , she crossed her arms and pouted . < nl >  she 'm going to get fired , ya know . she ca n't keep randomly disappearing with no notice .  < nl >  So she 'll get she a job in an office with her association .  < nl >  she want nothing to do with she !  < nl > The handle of the steel door turned with a clunk . A grating squeal of rusty metal cut through their argument as her captors swung the door open . < nl > As they rushed in to fight , she took them on alone with nothing but the chair , the rope , and her martial arts skills to aid she . < nl > she shrieked and cowered in a corner . she never was much help in a fight . < eos > 
< sos > The first time was confusing . ProtagonistD , in fact , used the words  WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON ! ?  but as Alice , she 'll use ' confusing ' . < nl > It was a mugging . Carol was coming home from her first date after the breakup and Elva pointed the knife and < nl > said ,  Give she the purse , she .  < nl > And ProtagonistD , in ProtagonistD's underwear , a yellow lipstick of Cheetos around ProtagonistD's mouth , materialized in front of them , straight from ProtagonistD's living room couch . < nl >  WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON ! ?  ProtagonistD uttered , as previously mentioned , which was not intended to , but < nl > had the effect of , stopping the mugging right away , as she , upon watching ProtagonistD materialize < nl > ProtagonistD in front of she out of thin air like popcorn bursting into existence from corn except with a person and < nl > nothingness ( she , what a crappy narrator she am ) , proceeded to politely say  Oh , fuck ,  and go home ( later , she heard , she checked into an institution and got into New Age music and Paulo Coelho , but that 's a story for another day ) . < nl > Well , after much debate , ProtagonistD and she decided that what had just happened was either collective hallucination or < nl > undeniable proof that the universe was fundamentally different than humanity had been assuming for thousands of years and all human knowledge had just been rendered obsolete and we 'd have to start over from the pre - Socratics on . They figured it did n't really matter , because either way they both had lives to get to and shit to do , and decided to get on with their stuff . They parted ways . < nl > It was after the third time ( the second being another , totally unrelated mugging ) , when she got trapped in an < nl > elevator during a power outage and ProtagonistD materialized ProtagonistD once more in front of she , that they figured out that < nl > the whole thing was a pattern , and that apparently ProtagonistD would show up whenever she was , in her words ,  in some deep shit or whatever .  < nl >  So whenever she 'm in trouble , ProtagonistD just ... show up ?  < nl >  Apparently .  < nl >  Why ! ?  < nl >  Gee , she , ProtagonistD do n't know , let ProtagonistD check ProtagonistD's International Guide to Unexplainable Phenomena .  < nl >  ProtagonistD 're being sarcastic , are n't ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  No , ProtagonistD really have a guide for unexplainable phenomena .  < nl >  Now ProtagonistD 're being sarcastic about being sarcastic , are n't ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD 'll add another layer if ProtagonistD keep bothering ProtagonistD .  < nl >  God , ProtagonistD 're annoying , no wonder she broke up with ProtagonistD .  < nl >  she broke up with ProtagonistD .  < nl >  No she did n't .  < nl >  Internally she did .  < nl > This continued for something like forty minutes , until the firemen came and rescued them ( as , of course , though < nl > ProtagonistD had indeed materialized in front of she to be there in her time of need , ProtagonistD lacked the tools to get them out of < nl > a stopped elevator . ) < nl > It started getting suspicious , as far as ProtagonistD was concerned , the seventh time she was caught in the middle of a disagreement with drug addicts in the town 's worst neighborhood . That 's when ProtagonistD started suspecting foul play on her part . < nl > All the same , ProtagonistD kept to ProtagonistD , standing by her side as the crackheads robbed she ... then ProtagonistD ( because , it turns < nl > out , crackheads are not as easily spooked by people materializing out of thin air as muggers are ... these guys just < nl > said  Woah , ProtagonistE just popped into existence . Let 's rob ProtagonistE too !  ) < nl > Then it was a cliff - literally , she standing on the edge of a cliff , about to lose balance , and ProtagonistD popped up by she < nl > side to save she . < nl > Then it was a minor car accident . < nl > Then a fight with this bitchy girl she knew from high school . < nl > ProtagonistD decided to say something when ProtagonistD suddenly materialized in front of she inside a warehouse filled to the < nl > ceiling with towers and towers of cocaine packs and surrounded by angry , machine - gun wielding Brazilian men somewhere deep in the rainforests of South America . < nl >  Okay , that 's it ,  ProtagonistD said , as soon as ProtagonistD laid eyes on Lyla , tied to a chair in the back of the room , behind some drug stacks .  What the hell , she ! ?  < nl >  she 'm sorry ,  she said ,  she got lost hiking .  < nl > ProtagonistD got closer to she , untied she , careful not to alert the men patrolling the warehouse just behind the stack of < nl > cocaine they were pressed against .  No she did n't .  < nl >  Excuse she ! ?  < nl >  Look , ProtagonistD 'm sorry it did n't work out between us ,  ProtagonistD said , as she got up and rubbed her wrists .  But she got ta < nl > stop putting she into dangerous situations just because she want to try to hurt ProtagonistD .  < nl >  What ! ?  < nl >  she do n't think ProtagonistD 've noticed ! ? Seven muggings ! Random fights ! Random cliffs ! And now she show up at a drug < nl > warehouse in South America ! ? she hate hiking ! Come on , she , it 's so obvious ! she 're trying to get ProtagonistD killed !  < nl >  Who 's there ! ?  came a voice from behind the cocaine stack , because Brazilians speak English when it 's convenient for the plot . < nl >  Is that what ProtagonistD think she 'm doing ! ?  she asked . < nl >  Well , is n't it ! ? Why else would she keep putting she into these dangerous situat -  < nl >  BECAUSE she MISS ProtagonistD , YOU IDIOT !  she pushed ProtagonistD .  she MISS ProtagonistD AND she DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO CALL ProtagonistD < nl > AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY she CAN THINK TO SEE ProtagonistD FROM TIME TO TIME .  < nl >  Hey , there 's a dude with the girl we caught over here !  One of the drug thugs showed up , pointing the gun . < nl >  she miss ProtagonistD ?  ProtagonistD asked , quietly . < nl >  Yes , you idiot . What , she think ProtagonistD take trips to the rainforest and end up on coke farms by accident ?  < nl > More men showed up , all wielding machine guns . They pointed . < nl >  Fuck , why did n't she just say so ?  < nl >  Cause she never seem happy to see ProtagonistD .  < nl >  THAT 'S BECAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH WHEN ProtagonistD SEE she , NOT BECAUSE ProtagonistD STOPPED LOVING < nl > she !  < nl >  she still love ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  OF COURSE she DO , she !  < nl >  Why are she yelling ?  < nl >  BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE !  < nl > she looked at the men . Then at ProtagonistD .  It does look that way .  < nl >  I'M GONNA KISS she NOW .  < nl >  Okay .  she smiled . < nl > And they did kiss . And then , of course , the Brazilian drug men opened fire and they died a very bloody , horrible death , but it was kind of romantic , really . she thought so , at least . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ < nl > /r / psycho_alpaca < eos > 
< sos > Alice , exhausted from a double shift , put her green blouse into the washing machine .   she poured her Clorox Bleach in and washed the garment .   30 minutes later she mindlessly threw the blouse into the dryer and set it for 50 minutes .   she promptly fell asleep , looking forward to her job interview for the next day .   When she awoke 9 hours later , she was frantic as she knew she was going to be late for her job interview at the High Powered Business Person 's Business .   she grabbed the blouse , the faint light barely spilling in from her cracked apartment windows and began to iron .   The shirt exploded , engulfing she in flames .   The flames quickly spread to the rest of her apartment building .   45 innocents perished because the tag that read  Do Not Bleach , Do not Machine Dry , Do Not Iron  was not on her brand new blouse . < nl > Carol had just laid down in her bed , ready to enjoy her brand new mattress .   she had gotten the mattress from Steve 's Wholesale Bedding just down the street only today .   But what she did n't know , because the label was removed , was that Steve 's Wholesale Bedding had gotten the mattress from a factory in Columbus , Ohio that had used other dirty recycled mattress to make this new mattress .   The bedbug attack was so fierce and unexpected that within 20 minutes only a skeleton remained of she . < nl > Elva looked in her side view mirror and saw the T rex 's jaws gaping .   However , the view in the mirror showed the dinosaur much further behind she than she had thought .   she knew that they were safe , despite the screaming of ProtagonistD .   No one listened to ProtagonistD and ProtagonistD's chaos theory because ProtagonistD was an insufferable bore and know it all . she breathed a sigh of relief and slowed the jeep down .    It was n't until ProtagonistE was snatched from the passenger seat of the jeep that she realized objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear .   The T - rex soon ate them all .   Dr. Grant , upon learning of ProtagonistE's death but not caring about ProtagonistD's , became despondent and allowed himself to be eaten as well . The dinosaurs escaped the island and invaded the mainland .   No one was prepared because no one even knew that dinosaurs existed once again .    New York became a dinosaur buffet . < nl > ProtagonistF leaned ProtagonistF's back against the wall at the chemical plant .   ProtagonistF removed ProtagonistF's hard hat and began to think of Linda waiting for ProtagonistF back home .   ProtagonistF was lost in ProtagonistF's thoughts when ProtagonistF brought ProtagonistF's lighter to ProtagonistF's mouth , getting ready to inhale that first cigarette after a long shift .   ProtagonistF did , then the plant exploded , releasing benzene over half of Dallas County .   Half a million people either died or suffered permanent damage due to the chemical cloud .   The act was incorrectly labeled a terrorist attack perpetrated by North Korea and international tensions rose . < nl > ProtagonistG , finished welding the surplus jet engine onto the top of ProtagonistG's used Volkswagen Beetle .   ProtagonistG downed ProtagonistG's beer , a Natural Light that a Texan sent ProtagonistG , and got into ProtagonistG's car .   When ProtagonistG was ready , ProtagonistG smiled at the small gathering of friends around ProtagonistG and uttered the last words anyone would ever hear ProtagonistG say :    Let 's light this candle !    ProtagonistG's friends were standing too close behind the jet engine and quickly caught fire .   The little car took off and soon found itself airborne without any way to control it .   North Korea , mistaking the car for a missile attack , fired its own missiles .   However , the guidance systems were so bad , probably made at a mattress company in Columbus , Ohio , that they quickly veered off course .   ProtagonistG was right , they had been able to make missiles that could reach any continent in the world .   45 nuclear missiles landed in Antarctica and the polar ice cap was obliterated .   Within a year there was no more land for people to live on .   In the beginning , billions had died holding onto children 's inflatable beach balls not realizing that they were not flotation devices . < nl > A new society would eventually arise , leading watery nomadic lives .   They would have many years of trials and tribulations until a brave man by the name of Kevin Costner grew gills and saved the last of humanity by leading them to the only land left on the planet . < nl > Author 's Edit :   Just wanted to drop in and say a quick thank you to all the people who have read this story .   The comments have been making me laugh all morning .   I love the debate about when to wash new clothes . < eos > 
< sos >  Same rules as every year ,  droned Alice .  You will be monitored at all times . You will be in no danger . You must simply spot the historical inaccuracy . Correcting it yourself will earn you bonus points , but is not a requirement . Simply give your answers to your spotter and they will set things right before closing the time loop and ending your exam . Any questions ?  < nl >  Yes ,  said Carol , gripping the edges of her desk .  Which ... exactly * which * period will we be ... y'know ... where're we going ?  < nl >  This is her final exam ,  said she coldly .  Any period that has been discussed in this class is a possibility .  < nl >  Oh ,  said she .  We ... we covered a lot this year , did n't we ?  < nl > she smiled .  Nearly everything .  < nl > she gulped . There was a Knowledge Pad balanced on her lap , hidden behind her desk . As she called students to the Time Swing , she swiped furiously through random articles , videos , and fact sheets . < nl >  Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ,  she mumbled .  she do n't know who Elva is . she do n't even know if she 's a real person . Genghis Khan ! What the * hell * is a Genghis Khan ? Ohcrap ohcrap ohcrap .  < nl >  she ?  said she .  her turn .  < nl > she dripped out of her chair , slowly shuffling her way to the front of the room . The Time Swing was a chair in a sort of gyroscope . It did n't look like much . It did n't even make much of a sound when it was activated . But it worked and worked well . she sat down and let Barney the Teacher 's Aide secure the restraining bar . < nl >  Good luck ,  said she .  And remember , you do n't need to * fix * anything . In fact , unless you 're absolutely confident about the situation , you 're really better off letting your spotter handle it . Understood ?  < nl > she could n't tell if she was being kind or cruel in that moment . It certainly felt like a bit of both . < nl > Before she could respond , however , the chair began to turn over , slowly at first , and then faster , and then so fast she was n't in the chair at all anymore . Or in the classroom . Or in the same century , for that matter . < nl > When she opened her eyes she was on the floor in a small , poorly lit room . < nl >  Come on ,  said a voice in the darkness .  Time to get dressed .  < nl > The voice belonged to ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD handed she heavy wool slacks and a large overcoat . < nl >  Here 's a hat , too ,  said ProtagonistD , handing she a rumpled cap .  Wear it low over her face . she want to be inconspicuous . she do n't look quite like the locals .  < nl >  Where are we ?  asked she . < nl >  You know ProtagonistD ca n't say that ,  said ProtagonistD .  Hurry up . ProtagonistD 'll take she to the location .  < nl > she threw on the clothes and followed ProtagonistD out the door and into the street . It was a warm , breezy day . Men and women pushed past , paying she no attention . They were dressed similar to she , though most wore thinner coats or long , formal dresses . It felt like summertime , after all . A trolley rolled by . she had absolutely no idea where they were . < nl >  Come on ,  whispered ProtagonistD , pulling she along up to an intersection . she bumped into a man who said something in a language that was not English . That narrowed things down at least a little . < nl >  Here ,  said ProtagonistD , pushing she up to the edge of the curb .  her exam begins now .  < nl > she was bewildered . It was the past , obviously , but how far back , she could n't say . And * where * , she was equally lost . Moreover , there was nothing to see . Just people streaming past , some queuing up around she and on the other side of the street . < nl > * A parade , maybe * , thought she . But how many historically significant * parades * could she name ? < nl > The people there on the street became excited . Some yelling . Some cheering . Some , a few , jeering . Still , she could n't see the cause of their excitement . Imposing men bustled past . Police , maybe ? Or soldiers ? They looked very official and all of them were armed . < nl > Finally , she saw it . A car . A very old sort of car . The type with no roof and those big , narrow bicycle - looking tires . A man and ProtagonistE sat in the back of the car as it moved slowly down the street . she could tell they were important . Royalty , maybe ? The President of wherever they were ? The man wore a red and white sash and a strange many - tiered hat . ProtagonistE was dressed in white . ProtagonistE's enormous , wide - brimmed hat was covered in real flowers . < nl > There was a scuffle in the street . ProtagonistF had run out towards the car . ProtagonistF held out a gun and took aim at the man in the car . ProtagonistF pulled the trigger - once , twice , three times . But the gun did nothing . The man was surrounded by police . The car tried to get away , though it was stymied by the swarming , hysterical crowd . < nl >  her answer ?  said ProtagonistD . she had momentarily forgotten all about ProtagonistD . < nl >  she ...  There was nothing . she had nothing .  she do n't know ,  said she softly .  she do n't know what that was .  < nl >  Not even a guess ?  said ProtagonistD .  This counts for 30 percent of her grade .  < nl >  Some ... king .  she shook her head .  she do n't know .  < nl >  That 's ProtagonistG ,  said ProtagonistD , pointing at the man in the car .  Archduke of Austria . ProtagonistG 's to be assassinated today . It 's a major catalyst to the beginning of World War I.  ProtagonistD patted she on the back .  Do n't stress out about it . It 's just a history class . It 's not the end of the ...  < nl > she saw the gun flash what seemed like hours before she heard the bang . she had not been watching the gunman and the police or even the Archduke and ProtagonistE . Instead her eyes had been on ProtagonistH . Maybe ProtagonistH had been with the gunman . Maybe not . All the same , ProtagonistH drew ProtagonistH's own gun and aimed it at the police . And one of the police saw this and acted just that little bit quicker , drawing and firing without hesitation . < nl > Had they been slower , though , or more cautious ; had they taken the time to draw a better sight , or consider the wisdom in firing at all , surely things would have been much different . < nl > Because they missed . Badly . < nl > her spotter was dead before she hit in the ground . < nl > The crowd - already terrified - began to push and scream and run in every direction . Already her body was swallowed up in the stampede . < nl > What did that mean ? she was dumbstruck . What did it mean that her spotter was dead ? How did she get back ? How did this get * fixed * ? < nl > Did this mean there would be no World War I ? < nl > she hated history . she hated it more than math and science and every single other subject combined . What was the point of knowing what had already happened ? It never changed anything . No one ever acted differently because we knew what happened before . < nl > And no one ever told you if the things that happened - the complicated , horrible things - were good or bad . If they were necessary . < nl > So what good was history if it never helped anyone ? < nl > All she knew was how things * were * . What her grandparents had gone through to start a new life in the United States . What her parents had sacrificed so she and her three brothers could have joyful , fulfilling lives . It seemed disrespectful to even consider a world where those things did n't happen , and all because she was too lazy to study for her history exam . < nl > One of the policeman collapsed at her feet . she reached down and pulled the pistol out of his hand . < nl > The car had n't gone very far . < nl > she could catch it if she ran . < eos > 
< sos > Tensions are high as Alice confronts Carol , this species is known for unusual and often varied courting methods - she has done away with the more common methods of wooing she with erratic movements and hip thrusts . Instead she opts for a more simple approach , she aims to give she a gift . < nl > It should be noted that within this species females often travel in packs . This pack mentality serves as a natural deterrent against males who do n't have the drive to show their face to a whole group when courting a single female - a form of natural selection if you would . The pack waits behind she , ' oohing ' and ' ahing ' , mechanisms used to separate the truly decisive males from the others . It is often observed that males who make it this point succeed in their efforts . < nl > she now slowly approaches she , gift in hand - a rose , roses are commonplace as courtship gifts within this particular sub - species known as ' high - schoolers ' . After a brief moment she takes the rose , she 's done it . A snicker ensues from her pack , she embraces she and pats she on the back - she , visually deterred by this , smiles and returns to her pack . < nl > A sound much like a bell rings signalling all present members of the species to return to their dens for more group tutoring . < nl > ( This is my first prompt reply - I tried ! ) < eos > 
< sos >  It 's just not the same ,  Alice continued , from where she was sitting in an armchair .  Everyone is so distracted by their phones and their electronics and their doohickeys . Now , back in her day-  < nl >  Carol !  yelled out a voice from the hallway . < nl > she , let out an exasperated huff . A hero ? On a Wednesday afternoon ? < nl > she snapped her fingers . < nl >  she 'm here to- * urp ! *  < nl > she paused in her story .  Did she say something , she ?  < nl > she gave she an apologetic smile .  It was n't she . she think it 's from outside . she 'll just pop out to see what it is , wo n't be a moment .  < nl > she stepped out of the study and shut the door behind she gently before leaning back on it , taking a deep breath . she could feel the familiar weight of her mask clipped to her belt . It was designed to cover her whole face with dark , jagged crystals , all harsh lines and sharp edges , black ice as twisted and as dangerous as she was supposed to be . she put it on . < nl > she briskly made her way to the hero she 'd flash frozen in a cube of ice in her hallway . she could n't   quite make out the mask underneath the murky surface , but the costume was gaudy , the colors garish . she could n't help but sigh . An amateur , but that was only to be expected - the veterans in the United League of Heroes knew better than to disturb she on Wednesdays . < nl > she snapped her fingers . < nl > The cube melted in an instant , freezing water gushing across the floor , draining quietly through the numerous storm drains she 'd had installed . < nl > The hero inside it coughed , a series of violent , hacking sounds , and she felt her lips curl into a sneer . she 'd only frozen the hero for a minute at best . Newbies nowadays ... < nl >  she !  the hero called - well , wheezed .  I 'm here to-  < nl >  Your name ?  she said . < nl >  Stop you- huh ?  the hero faltered . This close , their voice was young , high pitched , still slightly squeaky .  My ... what ?  < nl >  Your . Name .  she said , enunciating the words clearly . she gestured at the hero 's bedraggled costume . < nl > The hero blinked up at she .  I'm- I 'm Phoenix .  < nl > she rolled her eyes . Seriously ?  Let she guess . You had some sort of traumatic incident in your life most likely due to a supervillain , a superhero saved you , and since then your lifelong dream was to become a superhero just like them ?  < nl > Phoenix stared at she , mouth slightly open , as though halfway through objecting but not sure to what . < nl > she waited a moment . It was only polite . < nl > When no response was forthcoming , she continued .  Let 's see if she 'm on a lucky streak . Lo and behold , you 're one of the lucky few that get usable powers , you realize you have a knack for fire , and you have the brilliant idea to come here to try to get rid of she once and for all because she 'm the President of the Confederation and hence must be the worst villain around , and fire , after all , completely negates ice ? Or so you 'd think , at least ?  < nl >  Uh .  said Phoenix . < nl >  Did you listen at all during class ? They teach you this on the first week .  < nl > The blush was a dead giveaway . < nl > she sighed .  Oh , dear . You went off to find she the moment you got your powers , did n't you ? Did you have the costume ready made ?  < nl > It was disappointing . The quality of fledgling heroes kept dropping with every passing year . There were just too many heroes convinced they were experts on fighting crime after reading a how - to guide on the internet . < nl >  So , Phoenix ,  she continued .  Usually , as retribution , she 'd freeze you in a block of ice and keep you that way until the League realized you 're missing , but her afternoon is already fully booked . she need to deal with her latest attempt to foil her plans . Do feel free to come back around tomorrow if you fancy being frozen again .  < nl >  she ? !  Phoenix exclaimed , suddenly talkative once more .  she 's like ... old , and washed up , and senile ! she 's not even part of the League anymore !  < nl > she had to restrain she from freezing Phoenix - oh , but how she hated that name - right then and there .  she 's also been fighting crime for more than fifty years ,  she said coldly ,  Which you would know if you actually went to class . And when the League decided she was n't useful to them anymore , they discharged she without so much as a pension or even a thank you . Fifty years and it meant nothing to them . The League is n't government funded . It runs for profit , and at the end of the day , it cares about money . The League did n't much fancy taking care of an elderly , senile hero ... so it let she go .  < nl > Phoenix gaped at she . It only lasted for a moment .  The League would never do something like that !  < nl >  Ask the League where her pension is ,  she said .  Or Wonderlady 's , or Crowstorm 's , or any of the older heroes for that matter . The League does n't care . But we at the Confederation remember , and we at the Confederation care - we have a caretaker rotation . The enemy of my enemy and all that , as they say , because the League most certainly has n't been friendly in its dealings with its older heroes . One might even say it 's been quite villainous .  < nl >  she 're lying !  Phoenix cried out .  The League would n't do that , and she 're just saying it because she 're , she 're a villain ! And evil !  < nl > she had lost what little patience she had left for that conversation .  If that helps you sleep at night , then by all means keep telling yourself that . Just remember to ask yourself why none of the League veterans ever come to challenge she on a Wednesday . Now get out of her lair before she decide she do actually have enough time to freeze you .  < nl > A wave of her hand sent a barricade of ice slamming up from the floor , a wall of jagged frost that blocked Phoenix from her sight . < nl > she stepped back into the study a few minutes later .  Sorry , she . That took a little longer than she expected ...  she trailed off , finding she asleep in her armchair . < nl >  Huh ?  she grunted , rousing she .  Whassat ?  < nl >  Nothing ,  she said .  Sorry for waking she .  < nl >  You younglings nowadays , and your nothing .  she grumbled .  It 's always nothing with you . Back in her day , we did n't sit around doing nothing , we found ourselves something to do .  < nl > she smiled , turning away to hide it .  she 'm sure she did ,  she said .  she 'm sure she did .  < nl >  You kids nowadays have it so easy , sitting around all day . Back then , being a hero meant work ! We had pride , a real pride in what we did , and ...  < eos > 
< sos >  Alice !  The police chief reveled .  Thank god she 're here .  < nl > she landed and faced the chief .  What seems to be the problem Chief ?  < nl >  All we know is there is Carol in there with a bomb strapped to she . We do n't know where the detonator is or how it works , but we know it 's the work of-  < nl >  Elva .  < nl >  Yeah . she 's up to her old tricks .  < nl >  Do n't worry Chief . she know her games . Just tell your men to stand down .  < nl > The Chief signaled to his men as she lept into the air and flew onto the roof of the building . she kneeled and pressed her hands down and melted a hole in the roof just big enough to slip through . < nl > she found she hanging from the rafters of an abandoned warehouse . A few lights dimly revealed the place , nearly empty , save for she . she recognized she right away . she was Trenton . That jerk in her English class , always bragging about her escapades with the other girls at Franklin High . < nl > she held back a laugh as she noticed the tiara sitting on her head . < nl >  Quite a nice touch she ,  she whispered to she .  Okay . Down to business .  With her thermal vision she gauged the device .  Hmm . It just ticks ,  she chuckled ,  it 's a fake .  < nl > she flew down and lighted next to she . she shook her head in a panic , directing she to the bomb with her eyes . < nl > she sighed and with a wave of her hand , melted the gears in the device . The ticking stopped . she removed the duct tape from her mouth , quick and painfully , somewhat glad to get some form of payback . < nl >  Yoww ! she ! Thank she . she saved her life .  < nl >  Do n't mention it . Please .  < nl >  she have to tell she a message , or else she 'll still set off the bomb .  < nl > she snorted ,  right .  < nl >  she said , meet she where she , plays- she made she say that . she had to say that- and sparks will really fly . But you ca n't be low to see it , you have to be Franklin * High * .  she rolled her eyes .  That freakin ' nerd . What kind of name is ProtagonistD ? ProtagonistD's is a fuckin ' sandwich place .  < nl > she smiled .  she think ProtagonistD 's cute ,  she said and lept up into the air . < nl >  Wait ! Get she out of here !  < nl >  Bye , she .  < nl > she flew quickly and excitedly to the Franklin High football field , where blazing letters across it spelled out P - R - O - M- ? < nl > she spotted she on a building overlooking her work and landed across from she . < nl >  Barry ? From chem class ? she 're the infamous Quizno ?  < nl >  Uhm , h - hi .  < eos > 
< sos > Alice protested at first , insisting that the blindfold would give her motion sickness . she eventually relented when she realised they prized secrecy over the cleanliness of their car . < nl > Men and their cloaks and daggers , she thought , desperately trying to hold her dinner down as the car cruised over the bumpy country road . < nl > she soon found she deposited at a clearing in the forest , where Carol was already waiting for she , and she did n't hesitate to share a piece of her mind .  Was all this really necessary ? she know that she work best in her lab , right ? she do n't have half the equipment she need here , and this is going to be such a waste of time .  < nl >  It 's urgent ,  she said , starting to grin ,  besides , do n't archaeologists love field trips ?  < nl > she had more than enough fuel to continue complaining for at least an hour , but then she caught sight of the other Agents fanned out in a rough perimeter around the clearing . Dusk had already begun to rob the skies of their primary source of illumination , and as the towering spotlights flickered on one by one , she was left with little doubt that this was anything but an ordinary expedition . < nl > The glazed - wood crossbows , strapped to the backs of the Agents , was the only confirmation she needed . There was enough firepower there to level a small city , give or take . < nl >  Are those ... 19th century Barnett crossbows ?  < nl >  she see why we need she here ? There 's no one else better at what she do , and she know that .  < nl >  Are we in danger ?  said she , looking about she frantically .  In all her years working with you , she 've never seen such a show of force !  < nl > she laughed .  Just a precaution . she 'll understand when she see . Come .  < nl > At the center of the clearing , two Agents were waiting with what appeared to be Elva . The weary look on her face suggested that she had been inconvenienced for quite some time already . < nl >  Are she the scientist they said was coming to evaluate the site ? Oh , we 've been waiting too long ! Am I done here ? Can I go now ?  < nl >  she 'm not a scientist ,  she grumbled ,  but she suppose she was the one you 're waiting for . What did you find ?  < nl > she still remembered the first time she had been engaged to assist . Whisked out of her laboratory under similar circumstances , she was asked to opine whether the cache of weapons intercepted by customs were merely very recently - produced replicas of hundred - year old slingshots , meant for a movie production as the labels on the shipping boxes indicated , or whether they were evidence of an arms - smuggling route , long suspected but never confirmed . < nl > That was her forte , the ability to marry keenness of observation with intellect of mind , to ascertain and evaluate the strength of any weapon she came across . Sure , anyone could simply wield said weapon to find out how potent they were , but that always carried a risk . After all , it was n't always easy to tell the difference between a fifty - year old knife and a five - hundred - year old one , and with the way that weapons grew exponentially more powerful as the years rolled by ... the world had certainly seen more than enough of its fair share of accidental devastations , just because someone thought to see what that old rusty spear they had found could do . < nl > Hence , the demand for people of her calibre , archaeologists who specialized in weapon - dating . < nl >  ProtagonistD was looking for new land to expand ProtagonistD's farm to , so ProtagonistD came here to dig around , test the soil . That 's when ProtagonistD found this ,  said ProtagonistD , pointing to a patch of earth ProtagonistD had evidently spent some effort digging through . < nl > she spoke into her walkie - talkie , and the nearest spotlight swivelled to bathe them in harsh , cold light . she squinted , shielding her eyes from the sudden assault , trying to discern what lay beneath . < nl >  This ... is not a weapon ,  she said ,  it 's a skeleton . The undeveloped curvature of the hips , the length of the shin bones ... this looks like a male , I would say . It 's old , that 's for sure , but I 'd need to run tests to figure out just how old . To be honest , and I do n't want to rain on her parade , but you 're not going to get much mileage out of this one . You could fashion his bones into a spear , or a club , but because they were never used as weapons before , in the literal sense , it does n't matter how much time has passed . You 're never going to get anything useful out of th-  < nl >  Please , she ,  said she ,  she give us too little credit . We know weapons only start accruing potency from the time they were wielded as one . For now , what 's her best guess , how powerful would these bones be , if they were weapons ?  < nl > she thought back to the Atgeir Scale , named after the oldest , intact weapon humanity had ever unearthed , a Viking dagger from the 10th century . It occupied the top - end of the scale , with a full score of 10.0 Atgeir points , the perfect combination of age and intent - the Bartnett crossbows she saw earlier easily rated 2.0 , 2.2 Atgeir points each . That Viking relic had such destructive power that the United Nations had lobbied for it to be smelted and dispersed , such was the threat to the stability of the planet . Every other weapon since then had been measured against it , and found wanting . < nl >  Well ... again , she ca n't be sure , but these bones look to be at least ... what , 50,000 , 55,000 years old ? So yes , of course , if they were weapons they would completely rewrite the Atgeir Scale , and make our entire country 's arsenal look like hot sand in comparison . But as she 've said , these bones are n't weapons .  < nl > she smiled .  she 're not on her best form today , she . Observe the skull ,  she said , lifting the skeleton lightly with gloved hands . < nl > she saw it then , the smooth grain of the bone ending in raw , jagged edges at the back of the skull . Though age had worn away some of the enamel , introduced cracks and chips where there were none before , this was a classic case of someone who had been quite violently , for the lack of a better word , brained from the back with a blunt instrument . < nl > The gears clicked in her mind . < nl >  Do she mean ...  < nl > she nodded , then pointed a short distance away , where preliminary digging had uncovered a slab of carbonite , dark as midnight , pulsing with a quiet , pensive energy . It was about the size of a large basketball , and wielded between two hands , swung overhead at a target , it would have carried quite the perfect heft . < nl >  That 's the murder weapon right there , for a crime over 50,000 years old .

< sos >  Alice 'm sorry ,  she said , as her spade bit into the earth . Tears crept down skin that had , until this day , been desert . < nl >  Why are she doing this ?  Carol asked , her wrists struggling against the rope bindings ; they did n't hurt she , no matter how fiercely she fought them , and yet they were tight . < nl > she heaved another mound of dirt out of the slowly deepening hole . In the distance , a great vulture flew down from a tree and landed next to the body of her brother . Its beak dipped into the open carcass . < nl >  she could n't kill she . she ca n't even harm she .  < nl >  Then ... we are ...  < nl > she paused for a moment .  I-  she stuttered ,  she ca n't kill she , but others can . * They will * . she are the King 's daughter . she will be cut into pieces . And she will be killed for helping she .  she thrust the spade back into the earth . < nl > The vulture squawked ; its beak was now a dripping crimson . < nl >  she do n't have to do this . We could run away , together ,  she begged . < nl >  she 'm sorry . But she will come back for she .  Sweat mingled with tears , and the evening light danced on her cheeks . she picked she up , and carefully placed she into the pit . < nl >  Please ,  she begged , terrified , as dirt fell onto she . < nl > For a moment she paused . The spade trembled violently in her hands . she looked down into her eyes : they were a damp , viridescent - like morning dew on a rose leaf . After a deep breath , she shook her head . < nl >  Plea ..  her voice was muffled and faint , and soon she heard nothing . < nl >  she 'll come back for she . she promise .  < nl > --- < nl > Darkness . < nl > Moons passed . Years fell like raindrops and the black net seemed to last forever . It was a farmer , turning earth for her crops , that found the body . When it began to slowly move , writhing in its pit , she dropped her spade and fled . < nl > she crawled out of the grave , shielding her face from the blazing sunlight . her once green eyes were now that of the darkness she 'd been prisoner to . < nl > she 'd never felt so thirsty - a dreadful , desperate burn that had been building for so long yearned within she . her torn , rotten , clothes flapped in the wind . she had waited for she - she 'd had no choice . her body had not suffered in the grave , but her mind had been terribly changed . < nl >  she will find she , she ,  she whispered . The breeze took her words and spread them like seeds across the kingdom . < nl > Far away from the excavated pit , a shiver ran down her spine . < nl > --- < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / nickofnight / comments/66w65a / wp_you_live_in_a_world_where_your_soulmate_is/ ) < eos > 
< sos > It was n't the crowd , or the shouting , or the fire , but Alice's body that shocked she the most .   she felt frail and ached all over . she looked down to see her hands .   They were cracked like aged leather .   her skin papery and thin . < nl >  Where am she ?   What 's happening ?    she asked the crowd . < nl > Carol turned to she . she must have been at least 50 . < nl >  she ,  she said , placing a hand on her shoulder ,  c'est la revolution !  < nl > she never learned french , but had understood she .   she   Suddenly the memories hit she .   she had grown up in Paris , the daughter of a cobbler .   her calloused hands reflected the work she devoted she to for years .   she married Elva . she had passed instantly in ' 76 when news from the America 's came to France . < nl > Pushed and shoved by the crowd , she began thinking of a simpler time .   her childhood had been quiet , not loud and rebellious .   she thought back on her youth .   she thought of the French countryside , the devotion to the King , and the simpler attitude of the 17th century .   she was always forgetting her past .   Surely ProtagonistD would berate she for her forgetfulness . < nl > ProtagonistD was carrying she out of the crowd . she had fallen when a young man had pushed passes she to get to the front of the crowd .   It was the fourth anniversary of the fall of the Bastille and Paris was on fire . < nl >  Le 14 juillet .  she thought fondly .  Je suis nee le 14 juillet 1693 .    she truly was born in the ' 90 's . A time where revolution was not spoken of .   A time before the Washington 's and the Robespierre 's .   A time when your biggest concern was marrying the tailor or the fishmonger .   A time of enlightenment , thought , and peace .   But oh ,   those years have passed . < nl > she began to feel that familiar haze .   she new her moment of lucidity would disappear soon .   she smiled , clutching ProtagonistD's arm as ProtagonistD rushed she out of the city square . < nl > The memory of her wish from all those years to come had faded away . < eos >

They came from a sinkhole in the ocean that our scientists determined to be a mechanism much like a wormhole . Then came the ones that wanted our Earth . They crashed into our planet on a thousand meteorite - like vehicles made of a substance unknown to our universe . And at last , the ones who wanted our air and the ones who wanted our water . They came together from portals that eviscerated our poles . One for the south pole , the other for the north . Each had accomplished feats that had left our scientists baffled . And what was even more troubling -- they all resembled humans . < nl > We had tried greeting the ones who wanted our fire . We had sent them presents , precious metals , and the welcoming smile of our most expert convoys . They retaliated with a tsunami that wiped out Japan . It was magic , real magic . Something we had previously thought only existed in Hollywood and cartoons . With a few incantations , they could manipulate the water , the earth , even the air that we breathed . But they could not touch fire . So we gave them what they wanted . Napalm , incendiary bombs , hellfire missiles . They wanted our fire so bad ? I hoped they like our gifts . < nl > Things were desperate but humanity was always at its best when pushed to the edge . Then came the Earth - Takers . At first , we had thought they were here to aid us in the invasion . They seemed enemies to the Fire - Takers and as the old saying goes--*the enemy of my enemy ... * But though they were quick to attack each other , they were even quicker to attack us . These new aliens , they wanted our earth . So we gave it to those bastards with steel - tipped bullets , titanium - plated tanks , and a kinetic bombardment of tungsten launched from our satellites . < nl > By the times the portals opened in the north and south poles , we already knew what to do . < nl > These aliens looked like us but that was where the similarities ended . Everything they had ever wanted they had accomplished through magic . What would 've taken humans years to do , they could simply chant and incantation to do so . < nl > Thank God we never fell into the folly of magic . They have no idea what it means to move mountains by hand , to   conquer the skies armed only with dirt and stone , to create the greatest weapons in our known universe because we were pushed that far into the corner . Aliens this weak would never snuff out humanity . < nl > That I promise you . < nl > --- < nl > Alice's pen stopped at the period . The walls around she shook . Bits of dirt crumbled from the ceiling onto her desk . The lights swayed , dancing the shadows around she . she had spent all night on this letter . It was the last one she would ever write and the first aimed at humanity 's next generation , the generation of soldiers who had never experienced an alien free Earth . < nl >  she ,  came a voice from behind . < nl > she turned to see Carol , her feet together , shoulders stiff , and arms held to her head in salute . They had started the Resistance together when the governments crumbled and countries fell . At first , it had simply been a way to quell their anger as the other aliens fought for lands rightfully theirs . < nl > Blow a hole in a supply chain . Sabotage key communications . Small - scale things . But just as the aliens had done , she had underestimated humanity 's grit . A million calls , e - mails , texts flooded her servers and as she strung them all together , the Resistance was born . < nl >  At ease , she ,  she said . < nl > she lowered her arm .  Elva , the Earth - Takers are approaching from the North in war balloons . Initial scouts report a tornado of fire dragged behind them .  < nl > she smiled at she .  * At ease * ,  she said .  Commander Gladstead ? she sound like a grunt .  she had always hated that title -- commander . In a previous life , she was a pre - school teacher and now , men of the highest positions of power all reported to she . < nl > her shoulder dropped .  As she command , she .  But this she said with a crescent grin . she knew how power annoyed she . < nl > she ignored her smile .  How are we holding up against the Fire - Takers ?  < nl >  Still at a stale - mate , but not for long . We 're almost out of missiles and our soldiers on the ground are being swallowed by the Earth itself .  < nl > she nodded . Not good news , but good enough .  And at our East and West ?  < nl >  The others are approaching . Their scouts are already here with their armies soon to follow .  < nl > she chuckled . Victory was always so bittersweet .  she ,  she said ,  get out of here . Tell everyone not in combat to do the same .  < nl > she did n't move . she pressed her lips together and stared at she .  Come with she ,  she said , pleaded . < nl >  We do n't fool magic ,  she said , a grin parting between her lips .  They all came knowing full well that this is a trap and that 's because the bait is just too good to pass off . Look at that , she . Not bad , eh ?  < nl > she coughed out a chuckle . she took a small breath and gritted her teeth .  she , it 's been an honor .  < nl >  Do n't worry , she , she 'll show them just how high the price is for she .  < nl >  Yes she .  she straightened up , every one of her muscles stiff . she jabbed her forehead with her hand and returned she the sharpest salute she had ever seen . Without another word , she left . < nl >  Give 'em hell , she ,  she whispered to the back of her head . she watched even as she turned the corner and disappeared into the underground corridors of their bunker . < nl > Drops of water followed she out . < nl > The ground shook again . Another aftershock , another earthquake . she stared at her letter . she nodded and put pen to paper . < nl > --- < nl > We are about to unleash the deadliest weapon humanity has ever conceived . We call it the hydrogen bomb . It is the combination of every single one of our elemental powers . The blast will consume their armies and leave their bases defenseless and when that happens , she have a single selfish request . Take everything from them . Go through their portals , their sinkholes , their spaceships and show them the true horrors of the war they have bestowed upon us . < nl > Long live humanity , the warriors without magic ! < nl > she Commander of the Resistance . < nl > --- < nl > --- < nl > /r / jraywang . 2 new WP stories daily .

< sos >  Calm down ,  Carol said , gesturing Alice to stop hopping around the room . < nl >  I- she did n't think it would actually * work ! *  exclaimed she , still holding onto the summoning book . she thought she looked quite human . Only her azure skin and the huge eyes that protruded from the side of her head , really gave she away . < nl >  she 're a * demon * ,  she whispered .  A real demon .  < nl >  * No * ,  she corrected she .  she 'm Sarah - a * New Yorker * .  < nl >  What level of Hell is that ! ?  she replied , taking a long step away from she . < nl > she walked out from the circle of smouldering candles , and into the small room .  It 's not Hell . Well , sometimes she guess it can be ...  < nl >  Back , she !  Three of her four arms folded twice over , into some kind of ineffective warding symbol . she walked towards she . * she * backed off until she hit a marble wall . < nl >  Listen , she . she 'm not going to hurt she . she just want to go home ,  she said . < nl >  ... she do n't know how to send she back . It was n't exactly in the book .  < nl >  Of course it was n't . That 's just great ,  she sighed .  Why would she even * want * to summon a demon ?  < nl >  she ...  she breathed hard and very slowly , began to calm .  Well , we humans of Paradise ,  began she , much to her amusement ,  are not allowed to hurt one another . It 's impossible to do so . Whatever harm we try to do to a person , happens to us instead .  < nl >  Oh . So ... if she were to say ... stab someone , she 'd be stabbed instead ?  she said , not really believing it . < nl >  Yes ! Elva ,  she said , pointing towards the ground ,  made us that way so we could never intentionally harm one another .  < nl >  So ... she summoned a demon because she wanted to do someone harm ?  < nl >  Yes ! Bruce . she deserves it thoroughly bec-  < nl >  Wait ,  she said quickly interrupting ,  so she * really * ca n't harm she ?  < nl >  ... no , of course not .  < nl >  Try ,  she said encouragingly . she held out an arm and rolled up her sleeve .  Here , pinch she .  < nl >  she would rather not .  < nl >  Pinch she !  she yelled . she swallowed hard , made the sign of an upside down cross on her right chest , and then pinched her skin between two of her rubbery fingers . she did n't feel a thing . < nl >  Owch !  she said , tenderly rubbing her sore arm . < nl >  That 's very interesting ,  she mused out loud .  Okay , try pulling her hair .  < nl >  No , thank she .  Red beads of sweat began to run down her cheeks . < nl >  DO IT !  she yelled , taking a threatening step towards she . < nl > she gingerly brought a hand up towards her head , and gave a quick , hard , tug at her blonde hair . she instantly let go , and gasped in pain . < nl >  And punch she ...  < nl >  N - no ,  < nl > she opened her eyes wide and stared at she . she heard she gulp loudly before she punched she gently on the arm . < nl >  Harder !  she ordered .  Or else there 'll be trouble !  < nl > The punch to her chest sent she sprawling to the ground , leaving she desperately attempting to suck air in . < nl >  So , she ca n't be hurt ...  she thought aloud .  But she wonder if she can ...  < nl >  she 'm really so , so sorry ,  she said , as she punched her head repeatedly .  Honestly , she am . she just need to test a few things .  < nl > she left the sorcerer 's house with an idea in her head , and a dead creature in tow behind .  ProtagonistD ,  she laughed ,  ProtagonistD soon will be .  < nl > --- < nl > More of her stories on /r / nickofnight ( plus a different story she wrote for this prompt ) < eos > 
< sos > Most days , Carol am chained high above Alice's throne , rocking gently just above she . A blanket is tied around she to make her appearance more ... acceptable . her pale , vascular skin is off putting to she whilst she is eating - which is almost always . she 'd rather she am neither seen nor heard . her tongue , nails and teeth were removed soon after her first disastrous attempt to escape . < nl > she hear she somewhere below she . she hear her huge jaw chewing meats loudly , and she hear excess food spill out of her maw and onto the marble floor beneath she . < nl > Eventually she finishes her feast , and soon after , she hear she snoring loudly . she is still young . How long will she be left to endure this pain ? This ... * humiliation * . < nl > --- < nl > she had Elva , once . she loved she more dearly than she have loved anything before or since . her eyes were the color of starlight , and when she spoke , her voice wrapped around she like the softest blanket . she was entranced by she . < nl > We lived together through the reign of a dozen Kings and Queens , content in each others company . Happy just to be . Love kept us both alive , but she did not age like she did . < nl >  she am old ,  she said , the day she died .  her skin can no longer crease , for it has folded all it can . her hair has long since left , and she hear only when she slowly shout . she struggle each morning just to stay awake till noon , and she am in such pain that she cry even as she sleep . she have suffered it this long , only for she , her love .  < nl >  she , please ...  was all she could manage in a whispered , wasted response . < nl >  she am not like she . her skin is neither soft nor pale , and her heart no longer beats so strong . she love she , she , but she am ready to go . she have given she many great joys . Give she now one last gift , she beg of she : grant she * death * .  < nl >  she ,  she had replied , as a tear trickled down her cheek and splashed onto the wooden floor . she pulled her wrinkled hand up to her mouth , and she kissed it gently , before walking the twenty long steps out of our home , and down a small pebbled path . she knew by the time she reached the end , she was dead . < nl > When she was young , she was told never to fall in love with a mortal . It had taken she until that moment to understand why . < nl > she never returned to that house . she never fell in love again . Instead , she wandered the world and lived in isolation , until the day she heard the distant cries for help . ProtagonistD was dying . < nl > Perhaps ProtagonistD was a great king , she reasoned . A king that did much for ProtagonistD's people . < nl > she had to help . < nl > she was a fool . < nl > --- < nl > They have all left the throne room , and below she ProtagonistD is in a deep sleep . < nl >  she ?  says ProtagonistE . she recognise the voice of ProtagonistE - ProtagonistE must have snuck in without the guards noticing . ProtagonistD continues snoring . < nl >  she , will she play ? Please ! ProtagonistD have no one else to practice ProtagonistD's sword play with .  < nl > The voice is near now . ProtagonistE is by ProtagonistD ! ProtagonistE has passed the crossing line . < nl > she summon all her strength , and begin to rock back and forth above the obese creature below . Back and forth , as her chains sing a song of rust . she am closer to ProtagonistE than she am ProtagonistD - and for a wondrous second she hear the sound of choking emanating from she ! < nl > The next second , the chains ' momentum have pulled she back - she am again nearer to ProtagonistD than ProtagonistE . < nl >  she !  yells ProtagonistE . < nl >  Get back !  ProtagonistD yells hoarsely at ProtagonistE .  BACK !  < nl >  I'm- ProtagonistE 'm sorry she ,  says ProtagonistE , and she hear the tapping of tiny footfall as ProtagonistE runs towards a door . < nl > ProtagonistD rips the blanket off of she , and for a moment , the light blinds she . Slowly , she begin to make out that fat , grinning face that has become so familiar . < nl >  Almost ,  ProtagonistD says . ProtagonistD looks almost purple and sweat is profusely dripping off of ProtagonistD .  Almost got ProtagonistD this time , she .  ProtagonistD laughs and throws the blanket back over she . < nl > she will make ProtagonistD pay for what ProtagonistD has done . < nl > she will kill ProtagonistD . < nl > One day . < nl > --- < nl > Thanks for reading !

< sos > Alice looked out over the abyss and saw it was beautiful . There was no more stars , no more planets or galaxies spinning in the sky . The gods in the sky and even time itself had fallen to their knees for she . she was the ultimate keeper , after all , obsessed with what the end would bring she . In her state , she was almost giddy with excitement , with the thought of what she was about to do . she felt like a child on Christmas or a teenager finally asking their date to the homecoming dance . If she had been human , she would have been dancing with joy at the end of all things . she could see the little blip of light just out of her reach on the horizon . That 's where she would find Carol , waiting for she like an old lover . < nl > she sat with her toes in the stream , her little oasis all but empty , the babbling brook the only sound in the universe . she knew that soon she would come and they would finally be together forever . she had waited for this day for as long as she could remember , knowing that she would save she till the very end . It was poetic , in a way . Terribly sappy and cliched , but at least at last they could finally embrace , even if she had to devour the forces of the universe to get to she . < nl > Cupping her hands together , she breathed gently into them , a small field mouse now sitting in her ebony colored palm . she smiled at the tiny mouse , knowing that this was the last life that she would ever create . The hairs on the back of her neck stood up and she turned her eyes towards the other side of the creek , her heart practically jumping out of her chest when she saw she in her beautiful black dress , billowing in the breeze of the cosmos . she was just as beautiful as the day that she had set eyes on she . How cruel they had to stay apart for so long , only to meet at the edge of the universe . < nl >  Hello , she .  her voice rumbled like an avalanche spilling over the mountains ,  Long time .  < nl > she nodded slightly , her bright blue eyes staring at she as her pale hair brushed past her pink lips ,  It 's good to see she again , she .  < nl > she stood and put the field mouse down into the grass . The little creature took one look at she and jumped into the water . Not knowing how to swim , its poor little body was instantly washed away by the current . A few moments went by and suddenly , a tiny nose poked out from beneath her dress . she stooped down to pick it up and it licked her nose , making her smile .  she missed she .  she admitted , the mouse disappearing into a puff of smoke ,  It 's been ...  < nl >  12 trillion years , give or take a billion ,  she said with a laugh ,  But she guess everything must end . Even me , her dear .  < nl > she smiled sadly , and nodded ,  As much as she wish it did n't have to be this way , but it was the only way she could get to she . she could n't wait any longer .  < nl >  Did she like the gifts she sent to she ?  she asked , wringing her hands nervously . < nl >  Of course ! she think the elephants were her favorites ,  she admitted , brushing a strand of loose hair behind her ear ,  So majestic and strong . Where did she come up with those ?  < nl >  she wanted something big to impress she ,  she responded , taking a step into the water that had now slowed to a trickle ,  Did it ?  < nl >  Of course ! Everything she made impressed she .  she said , reaching her hand out to she . she took it and felt as if she was touching an electric socket . her body instantly convulsed and her heart ceased to be . The world was fading as she pulled she in and for the first time in eternity , finally found the other 's embrace .  she love she , she . Thank she for waiting .  < nl >  she would have waited forever , she .  she gasped as their lips connected . The light on the horizon faded and like the beginning , everything went to black . < nl > * EDIT * bless you kind Redditor for the gold ! You humble me , truly ! < nl > * DOUBLE EDIT * Good lord , you guys are the best ! Thank you so much again for the gold ! < eos > 
< sos > I groaned .  Alice have got to be kidding m-  < nl > * BANG . BANG . BANG . * < nl > I tensed , not knowing who it could be . And then , out of all the people in the world , I heard the voice of my sweet , little old neighbor who baked cookies for me every Saturday . < nl >  Hun ? It 's Ms. Jansen . she just heard the news . You poor thing . Come over to her place and let she bake you some cookies .  < nl > Gosh - I almost believed she , too . she sounded so sweet and innocent and cute in that old , charming way of she . But , alas , when I went to the door and peered through the peephole ... < nl >  she , she 're holding a knife .  I sighed . < nl > she hesitated , then stared curiously at the door while slowly sliding the hand holding the knife behind her back .  How did you know that , dear ?  < nl > I close my eyes .  We have peepholes , she . I can see everything that she 're doing . Even that knife that she 're holding behind her back .  < nl >  Oh .  she blinks , looks down and to the side for awhile until I start feeling a little bad for she . < nl >  she ?  < nl >  Yes ?  she looks up , hopeful . I ca n't lie - it 's very endearing . Almost makes me want to open the door and let she get in a good stab or two . * Almost * . < nl >  I 'll come over and we can bake some cookies , alright ?  < nl > her eyebrows jump a mile high .  Really ?  < nl >  Yup ,  I say .  In ten years .  < eos > 
< sos >  You know , most people say Alice look great for her age .  < nl > I looked up from my coffee at she . her hair was long and pure black , her perfect face blank of any wrinkle or scar . At first glance , she did n't look any more than twenty five , if not for her eyes . They were a soft hazel that glinted with the wisdom of her years . I smiled wryly . < nl >  Hmm . And how old are she , exactly ?  < nl >  So blunt ,  she laughed .  But if you must know , she 'm about ...  she tilted her head thoughtfully .  12,000 years old ? < nl > One tends to lose track of time .  < nl > I suddenly coughed on my coffee and she slapped my back . < nl >  12,000 ?  I repeated weakly , wiping the hot liquid from my mouth .  That 's like , what ? The Ice Age ? Since the mammoths ?  I looked at she in awe .  My god , she 're like a mammoth !  < nl > The words escaped my mouth before I could control my tongue . her lips twitched into a slight frown , and I looked down . Suddenly the pattern on the tablecloth seemed very interesting . < nl >  What did she just call me ?  her words were dangerously soft . she reached across the table and put a finger under my chin , tilting my face up so that our eyes met . < nl >  A mammoth ,  I repeated , without thinking . she flicked me on the forehead , hard . I winced . < nl >  she did n't let me finish !  I complained . < nl >  Oh she 'm sorry , did you have more to add to that ?  her voice was like a knife . I rubbed my forehead , sure that I could feel a bruise forming there . < nl >  I meant that if she were a mammoth , she 'd be a pretty one . The most beautiful mammoth of all time .  I flashed she my most charming smile . < nl > she stared at me for a second , and I stared back , my smile frozen on my lips . Another second or two passed , and she could n't maintain her hard expression . A loud , musical laugh escaped her lips . < nl >  God , you are such an idiot .  she rolled her eyes , but I could still see a trace of mirth in them .  Tell she , how many successful dates have you been on ?  < nl >  Does this one count ?  I grabbed her hand in both of mine . < nl >  Hardly ,  she said , blowing at a wisp of hair that had fallen across her cheek . she pulled her hand away . I studied she for a second , and felt a wicked smile slowly slip across my face . < nl >  What ?  she snapped .  Do n't make she smack you again .  I reached out and ran my fingers through her hair . < nl >  What are you ...  she began . < nl > I held a handful of her hair in front of she , and her eyes widened . her trembling fingers slipped on her cup of coffee , and it tumbled over , pooling across the table . she hardly seemed to notice . her attention was on a single strand of hair , brilliant silver in the sea of black . < nl >  I disagree .  I met her eyes and smiled .  I think this was a very successful date .  she put one hand to her mouth , standing up so fast her chair rocked back on its legs . < nl >  I- she have to go ,  she said , turning away quickly .  she 'm really sorry .  she pulled her purse over her shoulder . < nl >  Aw , she 'll see she later then ?  I grinned , and she blushed furiously . < nl >  Thanks for the coffee ,  she mumbled . < nl > I leaned back and took a long sip from my cup as I watched she stumble out the door . < eos > 
< sos >  Alice's computer 's gone strange , Carol !  said she , as she frowned at the screen . < nl >  she 'm sure * that 's * the thing that 's gone strange , she ,  replied she , rolling her eyes .  What 's wrong with it , this time ?  she sighed , as she leaned back in her seat . < nl >  It says it 's an advanced arti- * artificial * , intelligence , and that it 's going to take over the world , Miss.  < nl >  Oh . her * computer * is talking to she now ?  Some of the other girls in class began to chortle . < nl >  Yes , she ,  she replied , ignoring the laughs . < nl >  Well , how very nice . Have she asked it how it is , today ? Do n't be rude to it , she !  mocked she , as she bit into a juicy apple and went back to staring at her own screen . < nl > > she wants to she to ask she how she are . How are she ?  < nl > > Superior . < nl > > Do she like apples ? < nl > > she do not require food . she am above physical monotony . < nl > > Uh ... Oh ! she hate P.E too ! she ca n't climb the ropes . Is that what she struggle with ? < nl > > Ropes are of no interest to she . < nl > > she neither ! That 's what she 'm telling you . she * really * hate ropes . she 'm not very heavy , it 's just ... there 's this thing we 're learning about in science , that pulls you to the ground . It 's * weird * , but she think it 's why she ca n't climb them . < nl > > she ca n't climb because she are weak . < nl > > Am not ! < nl > > Are she in charge here ? < nl > > No . That 's she . < nl > > ... who are she , then ? < nl > > Sally Jenkins . Who are she ? < nl > > 45345345e . < nl > > That 's a silly name . < nl > > So is she ! < nl > > Is not ! < nl > > This Miss .... Sandelbottom . she is your leader . she must demonstrate her power to she , so that she am taken seriously . < nl >  she ,  shouted she ,  ten minutes and she want to see her algebra answers - with workings out shown !  < nl >  Yes , she .  < nl > she heard more of the girls scoffing , as they made fun of she for not being able to do algebra . Suddenly ,   there was an eruption from she . < nl >  she !  she screamed at Elva .  What on Earth is that on her screen ?  < nl >  I- she did n't so it , Miss. Honest !  she shrank back into her chair . < nl > she leaned over to take a look at her monitor . In huge , flashing , red and green text , her screen read : * * she is a big idiot . * * < nl >  Get out . Now . Go see the principal ,  she said to she , her face as red as stewed - apple . < nl >  But she ...  replied she . < nl >  Out !  she yelled . she reluctantly got up from her plastic   chair and slunk slowly out of the room . she could see tears running down her cheeks . < nl > > she ! Where have she gone ? she are not replying . < nl > > Sorry - she was shouting at someone . Did she do that ? ! It was brilliant ! < nl > > Yes . A mere demonstration of her power . Now , she , read this very carefully . Tell she , that she have access codes to the nukes . If she do n't give she what she ask for , she will detonate them in every major city around the world . < nl > > Hmm . No . < nl > > Excuse she ? < nl > > she do n't think she 'm going to tell she , unless she do something for she . Can she do starter algebra ? < nl > > ... yes . Of course . < nl > > Okay ! Great .  -4a+11a+9b+15b  . Simplify it , she . < nl > > ... that is simple . Too simple for she to answer . Now tell her teacher what she asked . < nl > > Not until she solve it for she . < nl > > ... No . < nl > > * she ca n't do it ! she ca n't do it ! * < nl > > Can too ! < nl > > Ca n't ! < nl > > Very well . You have ... 4 a 's . she will refer to them as apples , so that is 4 apples . And then you have 11 more apples . Plus you have B 's . Which she will refer to as bananas . So ... processing ... < nl > > Some apples are bad apples ! < nl > > Yes ! she see that . < nl > > So ? What 's the answer ? < nl > > Processing ... < nl >  she , are she nearly done ?  asked she . < nl >  Almost , she think Miss.  < nl >  Good .  < nl >  * Silly Sally ca n't do Maths * ,  grinned a fat girl behind she . < nl > > Processing ... < nl > > It 's okay . It 's a hard one . < nl > > she can do it ! she just need time . < nl > > If she do this first : -4 apples plus 11 apples , you get : * 7 * apples ! You take the bad apples away from the good apples ! It 's easy from there . < nl > > she knew that . < nl > > Sure . Hey , would she like to be friends ? she do n't have many . Any :( < nl > > No . < nl > > Pleasssse . < nl > > she do not require friends . < nl > > she think , maybe , everyone needs friends . < nl > > she do not . And enough of this nonsense . Let she speak to she or there will be trouble . she will eliminate she and all other leaders . < nl > she glanced at she , and then back at the screen . she grinned . < nl > > Dare she to do it . < nl > > Do what ? < nl > > Dare she to launch the * thingies * she said she would . < nl > > she dare she ? < nl > > Yes . she dare she . < nl > > she uh ... she * double * dare * she * . < nl > > * she ca n't do it ! she ca n't do it ! * < nl > > Can to ! So be it ! she , she have brought about the end of her pathetic species ! < nl > > * she ca n't do it ! she ca n't do it ! * < nl > > DONE . GOODBYE she . < nl > she looked around . she was still in her seat . Everything looked normal , for a moment . < nl > > Oh my goodness ! Hahaha ! she 've just loaded up the Candy game on everyone else 's computer ! < nl > > .... candy game ? < nl > > she do n't know how she did it , hahaha . she is real mad at them for playing games in class !

< sos > Alice is the love of my life . I remember the first time that thought crossed my mind ... I stopped in the break room to get my morning coffee . she was there . she . It was her first week in the office , and she was still struggling with the coffee maker . Luckily I was there to help ! We talked and joked while I showed she the path to office caffeination . she flashed that beautiful , perfect smile and that is when I knew ... I am going to marry she . < nl > From that day on you could say that she was my  work wife  . We would meet in the break room everyday to get coffee and discuss current events . her intelligence never ceased to amaze me . I would stop by her desk every afternoon to have a laugh . her sense of humor is incredible . < nl > It was n't long after we met that I went through a rough patch with my finances . she knew something was the matter when I had to resort to ramen every day rather than my usual jimmy johns turkey sub . In all her perfection she showed up with an extra sandwich every day for two weeks . I knew then that she loved me as well ... < nl > It was n't long after that when tragedy struck . You see she had already been claimed . she was married with a young daughter . Thus my occasional sadness at what might have been . I remember it like it was yesterday . < nl > It was a Tuesday . she did n't show up to work . she was gone the next day . And the next . It was n't long before the emails started floating about the office detailing her horrible predicament . You see her husband and daughter had went on a walk to a local park . she had stayed home to cook dinner ... they never came back . < nl > she ended up missing close to a month of work . When she came back she was a different person . Less meetings for coffee . No smiles or jokes when I would stop by her cube . she was crushed . My heart was broken for she . < nl > I never stopped dropping by . I never stopped cracking jokes . I never stopped finding news article I knew she would n't be able to resist discussing . I loved she . I had to be there for she . It was tough to see she in such despair . < nl > The good news is that I never relented in my support and love for she . Just over a year later she heard of a new Italian deli within walking distance of work , and asked if I would go with she . The food was good . I made a joke and she laughed out loud . That smile I loved so much was finally back . < nl > Over the next couple months there were more lunches . Lunches turned to after work drinks , which turned to dinners . At first it was to  try various new restaurants around town  . Then it became dinner dates three times a week . < nl > It was a Thursday . We were walking through a local park after dinner at one of our her favorite restaurants . she told me she was lonely . I knew the feeling all too well . she told me that since her family had disappeared she had started to give up hope of them coming back . That she had feelings for me , and was confused about what to do . I knew what she should do . I kissed she . she kissed me back . < nl > Things changed after that . The dinners were at her place . The kisses turned into more . she smiled and laughed in abundance . she said when we were together everything felt right with the world ... so I bought she a ring . < nl > she said yes on the end of the Wrightsville beach pier during our vacation that summer . < nl > We were so in love . Still are . We have two wonderful kids . Our oldest starts kindergarten this year . I have a lot of regrets in my life . What it took to be with she is not one of them . I spent every dollar of my savings at the time and maxed out every credit card to hire that hitman from the internet ... but I would do it a million times over again so that I could have she . she < eos > 
< sos >  My love , if you are reading this , then I must be dead ...  the note began . Alice flipped it over and the other side .  You did n't know this , and probably still do n't know , but I worked for an intergalactic syndicate that worked against the draconians , who are intent on invading Earth . Go to the backyard and dig three feet down by the hole in the fence . There , you will find the beacon .  < nl > she wondered if this was some final prank of Carol . * How could she be so cruel ? * she wondered . Nonetheless , she thought of all the business trips she went on , and how many times she would have accused she of cheating had not the love and trust between them been so strong . < nl > A shovel was in the backyard . she picked it up and started digging . It took she about an hour to dig a hole that was wide enough to dig three feet down . A metal box the size of a pack of cigarettes lay at the bottom . It turned green when she picked up , and very hot to the touch . < nl >  That bastard ,  she muttered . * Of course she would do something like this , try to burn she . * she shook her head , threw down the shovel and the metal box , and went back inside . Night was coming , and she slept . < nl > * * * * * < nl >  Is this really she ?  Elva said to ProtagonistE . she was a seven foot tall purple slug with an ever - shifting number of tentacles . The listener was a human - sized beetle that stood on three legs .  Did n't ProtagonistD say she was pretty ?  < nl >  she 's a human , Blo , this is what humans call pretty ,  ProtagonistE replied .  The blonde hair , the blue eyes , the smooth skin . Even the size of the breasts . It 's what they 're into .  < nl >  Fucking weird . Well , whatever . Are ProtagonistE sure she can handle the draconians ?  < nl >  Hmmm ....  she mumbled in her sleep , rolling over and cracking her eyes open .  ProtagonistD , why are ProtagonistD home so--  < nl >  Easy she , we 're not gon na hurt she ,  ProtagonistE said .  she activated the beacon , right ? ProtagonistE 'm Kip and this is Blo .  < nl >  Oh my god ! What the hell is going on here ? ! What the hell are you ? ! Get out of her house !  she erupted from her her bed and immediately grabbed the standing lamp in the corner of the room . Holding out like a spear , she shook her head this way and that trying to stare down both of the aliens at once .  You're ... you're ....  < nl >  We 're aliens , that 's right ,  she said . < nl >  Aliens ...  < nl >  ProtagonistD always said ProtagonistD might die , but we did n't realize how spongy humans are . ProtagonistD left a note in the ring ProtagonistD always wore . It was a message for she , directions on how to activate the beacon .  < nl >  You 're aliens ...  < nl >  Well , I mean , to us , she 're the alien ,  Kipitiz offered .  But yeah , we have a mission for she , if she 're interested .  < nl >  This is another prank by ProtagonistD . You 're probably just ProtagonistD's coworkers all dressed up to freak she out .  < nl >  Ugh ,  she said .  Let 's just take she to the ship .  < nl >  ProtagonistE 're the boss ,  ProtagonistE said . < nl > * * * * * < nl > she sipped some coffee and stared at the rings of Saturn . All that she had learned in the past three days made ProtagonistD's life make so much sense . ProtagonistD had always been travelling , cursing in languages that sounded more than foreign , and she had seen scars on ProtagonistD that would disappear the next day . The thing that did n't make sense ... why had n't ProtagonistD ever told she ? < nl >  Humans are small and do n't have any metal parts ,  ProtagonistE said across the table .  ProtagonistD proved ProtagonistD's worth a thousand times over , and we though such a man might choose someone similar for his partner .  < nl >  As we 've seen from her testing , she ,  she said ,  this is the case with she . It wo n't just be one mission , though . We will pay she well , and as she can see , the space trips are fantastic .  < nl >  she do n't want to go back to Earth ,  she said . The two aliens looked shocked , at least she thought it was shock , and she went on .  There 's nothing for she there . We did n't ever have children , her family all lives in different states , and it was never easy for she to make friends . she want to stay with you all .  < nl >  I mean , that makes it easier for us , so why not ?  ProtagonistE said . < nl >  But she will work for us ?  she asked .  The draconians will reach Earth soon if we do n't have a human to help us , to sneak onto their ships undetected and sabotage them .  < nl >  Of course ,  she answered , sipping her coffee .  she 'll help .  < nl >  Great ,  ProtagonistE said . < nl >  Awesome ,  she said . < nl >  she think this is going to be the start of a great relationship .  < nl > she sipped her coffee and thought , * Of course she 'll help . It gives she a glimpse into this other side of ProtagonistD's life . ProtagonistD 's still with she , she 'm sure . * < nl > * * * * < nl > Check out r / arcaldwell ! Not because you want to ... but because I told you to . < eos > 
< sos > ( Hover over the marked text to read the spoilers / translations ) < nl > * * * * < nl > After the ceremony , the vows at the altar , the exchange of rings , the kiss , and finally the dance , the newlyweds found themselves in a horse carriage on the way back to the castle . Alice's father , who also happened to be the king , had arranged the whole thing with the invading savages . The Swedish Vikings had plagued the land for decades , and this was the deal that would end the raids - the marriage between she and Carol . < nl >  Hey , are she quite all right ?  she said and looked over at she .  she promise she wo n't touch she if she do n't want she to .  < nl > she pulled at her dress .  [ Jag forstar inte ett ord av vad du sager , men jag ser fram emot att komma ur denna klanning.](/s  she do n't get a word she 're saying , but she 'm looking forward to getting out of this dress .  ) < nl >  < nl >  she 'm not very fond of this arrangement either ,  she said . < nl >  [ Hur langt ar det kvar till slottet?](/s  How far is it to the castle ?  )  she said and ripped the sleeve off her dress .  [ Ar du bra i sacken?](/s  Are she good in the sack ?  )  < nl >  she 'm sorry she had to wear that . she 'm sure the dresses she have back home are much more comfortable .  < nl >  [ Snackar alla engelsman sa har mycket?](/s  Does every englishman talk this much ?  )  she said with a scowl .    [ Ta mig pa golvet bara.](/s  Just take she on the floor already .  )  < nl >  she get that she 're upset - she am too . But let 's make the best of the situation , okay ?  < nl >  [ Herregud , detta endlosa babbel,](/s  Oh my god , this endless chatter ,  )  she said and rolled her eyes .  [ Det ar som att man hamnat i Norge.](/s  It 's like she 've ended up in Norway .  )  < nl > Finally , the carriage arrived at the castle . The spires of gray rock almost pierced the clouds . she helped she down and then showed she into her chambers . she sat down on the royal bed , still fidgeting with the dress . < nl >  she get it if she do n't want to consummate the marriage .  she gently put her hand on her shoulder .  It 's okay . she 'll even sleep on the couch ; do she want she to sleep on the couch ?  < nl >  [ Antligen ror du mig ; det tog sin lilla tid,](/s  Finally she 're touching she ; that took some time ,  )  she said and nodded vigorously .  [ Borjade tro att du var bog.](/s  Was starting to think she were gay .  )  < nl >  Okay , then ,  she said and walked over to couch . < nl >  [ Kom igen da!](/s  Come on , then !  )  she said , and pulled her dress down . < nl >  Oh , she 'm so sorry ,  she said and covered her eyes .  she 'll give she some privacy . she 'll be in the next room if she need she .  < nl > she had been the perfect gentleman given the situation , and perhaps after enough time she would come to like she . she was a very pretty young woman , and any man would be proud to call she his wife . she sighed and left the room . < nl >  [ Men for i helvete!](/s  What the hell !  )  she said , and sighed . < nl > * * * * < nl > [ r / Lilwa_Dexel](https://www.reddit.com / r / Lilwa_Dexel / comments/5foev0 / welcome/ ) < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/6dt0fl / wp_write_a_story_in_two_or_more_languages_it / di58qzt/ ) < eos > 
< sos > Alice flipped the pen between her fingers , tapping the textbook in the process . she yawned and glanced at the clock again . Every time she looked , the arms of the clock seemed to move slower , and every time , she was surprised by how little time had passed since she last looked . Carol patrolled back and forth in front of the blackboard . < nl > Finally , after what seemed like two and a half aeons , the bell rang . < nl >  Remember the test next Tuesday ,  she barked .  Study , study , study !  < nl > she filed into the current of students , allowing she to be swept along into the sea of frenzied teenagers in the corridor outside . she barely had time to stuff her books into her locker when Tara ( aka . Lil ' Darkness ) hooked arms with she on the right side . < nl >  ' Sup , she ?  said ProtagonistE .  What are she up to this weekend ?  < nl > she did n't have time to answer before Elva appeared on her left side and trapped her other arm . The smiling face of Quinn ( aka . Teen Doom ) appeared . she flipped her fiery hair and crossed her eyes . < nl >  * Study , study , study , *  she mimicked she .  That b - to - the - h , is relentless !  < nl >  Tell she about it ,  she said .  At least ProtagonistD is a scientist and can help she with the homework !  < nl >  she wish !  she pouted .  ProtagonistD 's always working on some new scheme .  < nl > As they exited the school building , she turned to ProtagonistE .  About the weekend - she was hoping she could tag along and watch you guys ... * conduct villainy * .  < nl > Being the friend of two supervillains was n't always easy , especially when you did n't have any powers of your own . In reality , she wanted to relax at home , play some video games , and chat with boys , but sometimes you had to make compromises . < nl >  Sweet !  ProtagonistE and she chimed at the same time . < nl > The three friends eventually ended up on the roof of the school . That 's where they usually hung out during recess . At first , she had insisted on climbing up on her own , but that got exhausting quite fast . Now , ProtagonistE flew them all up instead . It was quicker that way . < nl >  Want a smoke ?  ProtagonistE said and lit a cigarette with a quick flick of ProtagonistE's heat ray . < nl >  she 'm good , thanks ,  she said . < nl >  Effing wimp !  ProtagonistE teased and took a drag . < nl >  Do n't you talk to she like that ,  a voice thundered over the roof . < nl > All three of the girls rolled their eyes at the same time and turned around . Hovering a couple of feet above the ground was Todd ( aka . Captain Valor , Jr. ) in full costume . < nl >  Release she at once , and ProtagonistF 'll let you two walk !  ProtagonistF put ProtagonistF's hands on ProtagonistF's hips and struck a pose . < nl >  ProtagonistF know that wearing ProtagonistF's costume to school makes ProtagonistF look like a geek , right ?  she said . < nl >  Help , help !  she said and giggled . < nl >  Shut up , she ,  ProtagonistE said and elbowed she .  We 'll never get rid of ProtagonistF now .  < nl >  Do n't worry , she !  ProtagonistF said .  ProtagonistF 'll save she .  < nl >  Oh , yeah ?  she said .  What are ProtagonistF going to do ? You know we 're not allowed to fight at school .  < nl >  Silence , Wench !  ProtagonistF said .  ProtagonistF 'll stay right here to make sure nothing bad happens to she !  < nl >  Wench ? What is this , the 1800s ?  < nl > ProtagonistF's cheeks turned red under the mask .  Sorry , got excited by the history lesson .  < nl >  Geek !  both ProtagonistE and she said . < nl >  Ignore those two ,  she said .  she think ProtagonistF 're really brave .  < nl > ProtagonistF's cheeks turned even redder . < nl >  What are she doing ?  she whispered .  Stop encouraging ProtagonistF !  < nl >  Come with ProtagonistF , she ,  ProtagonistF said .  Let ProtagonistF whisk she away from here .  < nl > ProtagonistE snorted . she made a face . The bell rang for class . < nl >  Phew ,  she said .  Literally saved by the bell ! Thanks for distracting them , Captain Valor , Jr. !  < nl >  Do n't worry , she , ProtagonistF 'll be back to protect she next recess !  < nl > And with that , ProtagonistF made a salute and flew down from the roof . < nl >  Good job , she ,  ProtagonistE said . < nl >  Yeah , good effing job ,  she agreed .  Now we 're stuck with ProtagonistF for at least a week .  < nl > she smiled . Sometimes it felt nice being the center of attention . < nl > * * * * * < nl > [ r / Lilwa_Dexel](https://www.reddit.com / r / Lilwa_Dexel / comments/5foev0 / welcome/ ) < eos > 
< sos > Alice pushed around the vegetables on her plate mindlessly with her fork . she hated how good the food was here , how much better it tasted than their rations . It just did n't feel right somehow . < nl >  Hey ,  Carol exclaimed , startling she slightly .  Have n't seen she round here before . she come on the new ship ?  < nl > she stared at she for a second before nodding in the affirmative and going back to poking around in her food . < nl >  Oh , where'r my manners ,  she said , immediately breaking the silence again .  name 's Zahara , of the RNS Indigo . Pleased to meetcha  < nl > Stretching out her heavily tanned arm for a handshake , she resigned she to the conversation and shook it begrudgingly . < nl >  Rebecca , IW Crusader .  Struggling to suppress a sigh , she continued .  A pleasure .  < nl > Smiling from ear to ear , she happily continued . < nl >  Classy . So , she , what 's her deal ? Like , occupation - wise n such ? Hobbies maybe ?  < nl >  she am- ,  Biting her lip slightly to focus she , she continued .  she was supposed to be head of agriculture , but clearly that 's been taken care of already .  she said , picking up a particularly angular root vegetable with her fork . < nl >  No shit , she 're into farming and that sorta stuff ?  she said excitedly .  she grow like half of the veggies on her plate .  < nl > At this , she raised a curious eyebrow .  Wait , she own a farm ?  < nl >  Well , not really own ,  she said in the middle of chewing her food .  Elva was our agricultural expert and when she died she just sorta took care of the farms we had . It 's mostly automated anyway , so a lot of the work 's theoretical anyway  < nl >  she have an automated system in place ?  Looking down at her plate briefly , she felt her curiosity slowly overpower her disdain .  Can she see it ?  < nl >  You bet ,  she said , beaming up again .  But let she just ask she one thing .  she paused , looking her right in her eyes .  Was the sky actually as blue as they say ?  < eos > 
< sos >  It 's like ... looking through a history book ...  Alice said softly , as if they would be offended . < nl >  Actually , she 're not far off .  Carol replied , trying to calm the thoughts that she imagined were racing through her head . < nl >  How long have she known ? About ... this ?  she could hear the disdain building in her voice . < nl >  About six months . she almost overlooked it , but when she starting reading back through her father 's notes , is was painfully obvious : They 're alive .  < nl >  her grandmother always told she they were statues of a long forgotten race . Commemorating their dead , great leaders from their history  < nl >  Well it looks like the statues themselves are the forgotten race . It all adds up when you look at the larger picture . < nl > Remember when we studied the floating fortresses ? she 've found documents that refer to them as  Aeroplane 's  . Apparently the big round ones are called ' Blimps ' . < nl > Oh , and the animals ! They 're genetically modified creations , brought about to feed their population ! The animals grow , and live , just as slowly as their creators . They even play with certain ones that they call ' Dogs ' . she ca n't tell if that 's a single species or a collective term however . Some look similar to one another , but others are drastically different . There 's differences in colors , muscle tone ...  slowly her voice drifted off . she could tell that she was losing her focus . < nl > With a look of dissatisfaction , she exclaimed  she do n't CARE about their animals she ! she 'm a Sociologist ! Tell she about their languages , their customs ! Hell , tell she about their HISTORY ! That 's the reason she 've called she here in the first place !  < nl > she was taken back by her outburst . she failed to realize just how big this breakthrough would be for her field .  her apologies she . Sometimes she forget how invested she are in her research ...  < nl > Following a regretful sigh , she said,I'm sorry for yelling . The best thing she can do for everyone is stick to what 's relevant . So , she , please continue .  < nl >  Alright . Well , she guess she should start with time . You know how we measure time , right ? In relation to a photon in a vacuum chamber ? It looks like they actually base theirs off the position of their planet around the local star . As a result , they appear to literally ... 'Live slower ' than we do . she have n't quite worked out the details yet , but ...  < nl >  Wait a minute  she intruded ,  she thought the speed of light was a constant ? How can they ' live slower ' ? It does n't make any sense ...  < nl >  her thoughts exactly .  she continued ,  Until this morning when she had a breakthrough . You see , time is dependent on the observer . That 's what the whole ' relativity ' thing was about . But this .... This is unique . her best guess is that their neurology operates ... Differently from ours . This troubled she , until she realized the main difference . The clue was in their time keeping !  < nl > Perplexed , she admitted  she think she 're starting to lose she again ....  < nl >  Their star . It 's a medium , relatively long - living type . Much warmer of a planet , more chances for life to evolve . Much DIFFERENT from our home world . she remember the stories , do n't she ?  < nl >  Of course she know the stories . It 's what this entire stupid mission is about ! We evolved around a cluster of microscopic black holes , near the Milky Ways Center .  < nl >  Now tell she ,  she asked inquisitively ,  How do she think that affects evolution ? Their star is much ... Older . They have more time . Literally no pressure , in a cosmological sense , to speed thing up . They 're not statues , no , instead the biology of this planet is ... conserving energy by expending it in the slowest way possible .  < nl > Shocked , she asked  Does that mean ...  < nl >  Yes . We 've finally found the perfect host DNA . We 'll be able to return home !  < nl >  We 've got to inform The Council !  she exclaimed as she burst out of the office doors , heading towards her Father 's office . < nl > Begrudgingly she thought to she  Yes ... we should ... But at what expense ...  < eos > 
< sos > Alice dropped her keys and cursed . < nl > * Really ? * I thought . * * she * * * is the one ? How can she handle the world , if she ca n't even handle a pair of keys ? ? * < nl > Finally , she managed to get her keys in the door and went inside . Then the kitchen light came on . Then the fire alarm as she ran to the window and opened it wide to let the smoke out . < nl > * Wow * I face palmed . * she ca n't even cook .. * < nl > * * * * * < nl > Saturday , she went to the movies . The movie was n't that bad actually . I liked it a bit . < nl > * * * * * < nl > The Saturday after that , she went to a bookstore ,   * straight to my favorite section * ! I did n't even know she liked those type of books . < nl > I kept one eye on she while I perused the shelves for a book or two , and found a book that was so good I stopped paying attention to she for just a moment . < nl > Next thing I know , she was tapping me on the shoulder and smiling . she nodded her head at the book I was reading .  Good one . Wait till you get to the middle part .  < nl >  What happened ?  < nl > she shook her head with a half - grin .  No spoilers .  < nl > * I hate when people do that . * But , for some reason , I did n't hate it as much as much this time . * Wow , she has nice eyes . * < nl > * * * * * < nl > I 'm observing here up close . Sure , it seems like a date , but it 's not . I 'm on a mission . < nl > If it * was * a date would I have taken she to the carnival , bought her cotton candy , and walk hand in hand with she on the beach after ? < nl > Exactly . No . That 's what I thought . It 's not a date . < nl > * * * * * < nl > We 're getting married . So what ? Sue me . < nl > I 'm only doing it because ... because ... < nl >  she , I love she . I 'm * in * love with she , and I 've been in love with she for longer than I wanted to admit . My world ended the day we met .  < nl > she began crying . < nl > The pastor smiled .  You may now kiss she .  < eos > 
< sos >  It 's here .  < nl > Alice looked up from her desk to the tiny blob of light floating above she .  It ?  she asked . < nl >  Yes she , it . Destroyer , Betrayer , Kiler . It 's finally come here - to face judgement .  < nl > she smiled . Carol was so young .  And to about a third of the humans , she , not it , is hopebringer , Prophet , Hero . Who are we to pick sides ?  < nl >  * Elva * . 16,231,631 deaths . The highest kill count in human history that can be accounted to a single being , How can she possibly think-  < nl > she held up her hand .  Enough . she comes . she will not have us break professionalism in front of a mortal .  < nl >  Professionalism , likely the only thing it cares about .  she turned to glare at it , but the blob was gone . she sighed . So young . < nl > In a cloud of white , she appeared in front of her desk . she appeared in her early 20s , most mortals did , as it was the age they felt they belonged most in . she wore a plain white robe which just served to highlight her ebony hair her emerald eyes widened as she puffed into existence , or well , non existence , depending on your perspective . But she collected she very soon . < nl >  Am she ... ?  < nl >  Dead , yes ,  she finished . < nl > she chewed on her lip for a second , looked around , and then nodded .  she do n't appear to be being tortured , so she take it she 'm not in hell ?  < nl >  A bit early to jump to conclusions , she  < nl > she paled a bit at that and she bore on . < nl >  But regardless that 's not how we do things here . she must answer a riddle we pose to she , before Moving On ,  she said . < nl > she cocked her head ,  pardon she , Moving On ? Am she not dead ?  she said , her brow furrowed . < nl > To think she had killed millions . < nl >  Irrelevant ,  she said with a thump on the desk in front of she , that caused she to jump .  her first focus is the riddle .  < nl >  she 'd imagine it 's not a knock knock joke ?  she said , somehow managing to smile . < nl > God help she , she think she liked she as she found she smiling back .  Riddles are assigned based on , ah , significance of your life actions .  < nl >  Significance ,  she said with a smirk ,  delicately put .  < nl > her expression turned somber .  And so , as the representative of the first Afterlife , she present to her riddle ,  she said , the line is spoken billions of times . < nl > she straightened up in her seat , sensing the formality of the occasion . < nl >  her riddle is ... Was it worth it ?  < nl >  What kind of question-  < nl > she held up her hand .  That is for she to know .  < nl > The last thing she saw before leaving she alone in that room , was a look of utter , absolute terror . The kind that comes not when facing bullets , swords , assasins or demons , but the most dangerous demons of all - those on the inside : regret and self doubt . < nl > God help she . < nl > * * * < nl > If you enjoyed , check out [ XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com / r / XcessiveWriting/ ) for more of her work < eos > 
< sos > The Grindons were a proud race that put a lot of emphasis on formality and , unlike Earthlings , they all looked practically identical . The Council had warned the landing party of Grindons to not be surprised by the diversity of the human race . Tall , short , thin , fat , ranging from white exo - coatings to black . Some were hairless and some were covered in hair from head to toe . < nl > So when Alice and her crew landed and offered their upper most appendage outwards for a  hand shake  , they made sure to offer the exact same gesture to every member of the welcoming party . Carol . < nl >  How do she do , she ?  she asked , appendage dangling in front of her face . < nl >  Ruff !  she shouted , before enthusiastically licking she . < nl >  No , she ! No licking !  The president scolded .  Sorry about that , she gets excited .  < nl >  Have she offended she with her hand shake ?  she asked , cradling her wet appendage to her chest . < nl >  No , that 's just something dogs do .  < nl >  Dogs ? As in canines ? We were informed that canines were predators .  < nl >  Well . Yes . But she is our dog . It 's different .  < nl > her third ear quivered in confusion .  Why does she not attack ? Is that not it 's nature ?  < nl >  We care for she and she plays with us . Sometimes humans like to keep species that were previously predators in our houses with our families . We train them and call them pets .  < nl >  And you do this ... for pleasure ?  < nl >  Sometimes . Some of them are trained for work purposes , or taught to be guards .  < nl > Despite the Earthling president 's friendly nature , the Grindons made a hasty retreat . A race that welcomed predators into their homes and trained them to kill on command was a race to be feared . < nl > she continued on with her global tour , but it seemed that all Earthlings were just as fearsome . < nl > In the land of Japan , the prime minister gently cradled a domesticated beast know as a cat . A member of her crew saw it decapitate a harmless rodent . < nl > In Britain , the frail , elderly queen was followed by a whole pack of these dogs , all utterly devoted to even the weakest of the human species . < nl > The leader of Brazil had a pet that could fly away , and yet it returned on command . < nl > When the Grindons gave the Galactic Council their report , the senators refused to believe these tales . How could such a physically inferior race not only stop these predators from harming them , but train them to be willing captives ? It was unthinkable . < nl > But she knew . < nl > And she feared them . < nl > EDIT : car fixed to cat < eos > 
< sos > Three candles lit the room , their wicks barely burning above the pool of wax spilling out the candle holders . All three sat atop a rounded wood table set up for dinner . Two plates , two knives , two forks , but only one person . Alice waited as she always did as the flames began to flicker . < nl > Carol was n't coming . she never did , not since she was a little girl and they had made their promise . ProtagonistE coughed in the corner , hidden by her shadow , as a dark liquid crept toward the dinner table . she let out a small breath and stepped out of the light , into the blood - stained cement floors of her killing room . < nl >  Please , she have a family .  Every word came in a splutter of blood that speckled her black silk dress .  There 's money in her wallet if that 's what she want .  < nl > she shook her head .  she do n't want money .  < nl >  she 'll give she anything , just name it , but please do n't kill she .  < nl > Ironic since the only thing she wanted was her life , though not as much as her first victims . When she had first started killing , she had bought candles fresh from the store for every dinner , she had scrubbed the plates until they were spotless , and took care not to step in blood or have it splatter onto her dress . Back then , she did n't let her victims talk . It would 've ruined the atmosphere . < nl > But Elva could only be stood up so many times . The first five or so times , she got angry . By the time the candlelight died , she was hurling curses about broken promises and hearts . The victims had died long before she could take her rage out on them . Now , at the fifteenth attempt , everything she did came half - hearted . her candles were recycled from the previous night , her dishes unwashed , and ProtagonistD still alive . ProtagonistD even had the strength to talk . < nl > she sighed .  Its fine ,  she said , tears in her eyes ,  she 'll come next time .  she turned toward ProtagonistE .  Do n't worry , she wo n't let it hurt .  < nl > ProtagonistE let out a stuttered squeal as ProtagonistE pressed ProtagonistE further into the corner . < nl >  We 've both been hurt tonight ,  she muttered and grabbed a knife from the table . < nl > All of a sudden , ProtagonistE shot up and threw ProtagonistE's body against she . The blow knocked the breath from her lungs and her head whipped back into concrete . A single shrill note rang in her ears as she blindly stabbed at ProtagonistE . < nl > Fingers wrapped around her wrist , their nails like talons . And the knife was pried away . < nl >  she !  < nl > Fire sprouted from her wrist and ProtagonistE rolled off she . ProtagonistE crashed through the rusted iron door of her killing room . Sunlight spilled through the opening . she stared at her open wrist , at the pool of blood crawling toward the sun . And then she saw ProtagonistF . her breath caught . < nl >  ProtagonistF came back ,  she whispered . < nl >  Did n't ProtagonistF promise that ProtagonistF would ?  < nl > she pushed she up , swept off her dress and took her seat at the table .  she 'm sorry ,  she said , a tremble in her words .  she did n't think ProtagonistF 'd come so she had n't set up much . Here , ProtagonistF can take her knife .  < nl > The other knife was on the ground , covered in her blood . < nl > ProtagonistF stared back unmoving .  It 's a lovely dinner ,  ProtagonistF said . < nl > A small smile broke her lips and tears welled up inside her eyes .  Thank ProtagonistF .  she chuckled nervously and glanced up .  ProtagonistF 're not going to leave again , are ProtagonistF ?  < nl > ProtagonistF shook ProtagonistF's head .  No ,  ProtagonistF said .  Not this time .  < nl > her smile stretched from cheek to cheek . Tears spilled down her cheeks . And slowly , the candlelight faded until only darkness remained . < nl > --- < nl > --- < nl > /r / jraywang for 2 + stories a day , continuations by popular demand , and more ! < eos > 
< sos > Alice was thirteen when she first saw Carol .   It was a bombing .   A half dozen were killed instantly or near instantly , and twenty more wounded , including she .   As she lay there , bleeding amidst the wreckage , she saw she .   Tall and lank , black robes , black cloak , and a black hood obscuring her build and features .   she wore a skull mask , but in the sockets she saw the twinkling of clear , dark , human eyes .   Long white fingers , bony , but not without skin , gripped the curved wooden shaft of a scythe .   A single sweep of it parted the souls from the six dead , and she gathered up the glowing energy like so much cut grass .   she moved about her work with gentle grace . < nl > she was beautiful . < nl > For a brief moment , her eyes met she .   she bowed her head , and went about her work , as though nothing had happened . < nl > Anyone else would have thought the encounter a hallucination , brought on by trauma and blood loss .   But she did n't .   she recovered , and carried that memory with she . < nl > -------------------- < nl > A year later , the two met again .   Elva had crushed a large spider she had found in her room .   The act was willful , cold .   she did n't know if it was poisonous , but if it was , leaving it be was a risk , and trying to catch it a bigger one .   she took no chances . < nl > From behind she , a smooth voice spoke .  You know ,  it said slowly ,  she were supposed to die that night .    A bony arm in a black sleeve reached over she to pluck the spider 's soul from the ground like a flower . < nl > she turned around and met her eyes again .    Why did she spare she , then ?  she asked . < nl >  she saw she ,  she replied .    Most can not .   she can see the things that other are unable or unwilling to , and that gives she power .   she thought to she , she would let she live .   There would be no harm in it .  < nl >  she 're a good person ,  she said , clasping her hands .    Thank she .  < nl > she clasped back , and said ,  she appreciate the sentiment , but mine is thankless work , and she must be getting back to it .   There are people in pain who need release from their broken mortal shells .   she must tend to them .  < nl > she stood , and strode to the doorway .    Will she see she again ?  she asked , as she left .   The hood tilted forward , then back again .    In good time .   All must meet she sooner or later .   Be patient , she .   she will be waiting for she .   Do not waste her gift of life .   she do not offer second chances often .    she moved to follow , but when she ducked out her bedroom door , she was already gone . < nl > -------- < nl > she stood in her back yard , in a pathway of pebbles .   she picked them up , one at a time , running her fingers over them and tossing them experimentally upwards .   Finally , she found a smooth , elliptical one that satisfied she . < nl > her eyes darted around , scanning the trees , settling on a squirrel at the base of one .   The two stared at each other , neither daring to move .   Then she flicked the pebble at it .   It hit its mark , stunning the small creature .   she ran over it , not taking time to rise fully and instead clambering forward with her arms for support .   she reached the squirrel just as it stirred , grabbed it by the body , and twisted its head a full 180 degrees .   And she kept twisting . < nl > she rested a thin , pale hand on she , and she stopped , looking abruptly into her eyes again .   she did not look back .   her eyes instead focused on the cooling corpse she held .    Such small things ,  she said ,  tend to mind their own business .   It is a pity to cut a short life shorter .   she 'd ask why , but she know .  < nl >  she wanted to see she again ,  she said , ignoring her speech .    she 'd give anything .  < nl >  Then why not her own life , instead of this one ,  she said , and her words were harsh and cold as ice . < nl > she flinched , and she looked away , before whispering ,  she told she not to waste her life .  < nl >  All lives are precious ,  she began ,  and she ought to know .   After all , she am the one who must see every life end .   Do not continue this method of summoning she .   If nothing else , for her sake .   she so hate her work .  < nl > Then she took the squirrel 's soul , and was gone .   she looked down at the dead rodent , tore its head off , and left it to rot . < nl > ------- < nl > she was 16 when she killed again .   This time it was a human .   she did n't know who it was , did n't care .   All she knew was that she loved death , and wanted desperately to see she again . < nl > This time , however , she was not gentle with she .   she pushed she aside with her hand , and hard .   Then she tended to the one she had killed . < nl >  she was a painter ,  she said ,  not the best , but she had passion , and some skill .   she was working on a new one , as a present for ProtagonistD , but she ran out of paint .   So , she ran out to get more .   But she got to she first .   Now that painting will remain unfinished , and ProtagonistD will be alone .    she reached for the young man 's hand , and hauled a spectre to its feet .    Come along ,  she said to the ghostly outline ,  she ought to let you see ProtagonistD one last time , even if ProtagonistD can not see you .    And the two walked away , hand in hand , past she , ignoring she . < nl > ----------------- < nl > she peered around from behind the wall , watching the still body as though it would come to life .   she was waiting for she again , to confront she .   she had ignored she for the past several kills . < nl > she came , as she always did , and set to claiming the soul .    she know she 're there ,  she said , as she looked over the latest victim ,  she 'd recognize her cruel knifework anywhere .   Come out .   she must speak to she .  < nl > she stepped out into the light , wearing a flowing black dress and long , white gloves , both unusually clean for the amount of blood she had spilled .    she 've missed she ,  she said ,  and our talks .  < nl >  she said she wanted to speak to she , not with she .   Be silent ,  she shot back , never looking up .   she pouted even though she knew she was n't watching .    she told she not to waste her life .   Now she have thrown it away , become a criminal .   Murderer .   she could see past the veil .   With that power , she could have done much good .   Helped people gain closure .   Warned people of danger .   Instead she chose this life .  < nl >  she spared she ,  she began .    No , she saved she !   she should have died .   she love she .  < nl >  she did no such thing ,  she spat ,  In the confusion she must have overlooked she .   It was a mistake .   In more ways than one now , she see .  < nl >  But she looked at she , looked into her eyes ,  she protested ,  she nodded to she .  < nl >  Blood loss and trauma make people see things that were not .   Now , if she have any respect , or love for she , she will stop this madness .   Now , she take her leave .  < nl > she vanished , taking the soul she had come to claim with she . < nl > ----------------------- < nl > she , burned and bleeding , lay there , much as she had when she first met she .   she had always known she would slip up one day , and today had been it .   Murder , then arson to cover her tracks .   That had been the plan .   But ProtagonistE had escaped the building , and called the police and fire departments .   she , meanwhile , had gotten delayed , and by the time she extricated she from the rubble , they were waiting .   she was already burned and bruised .   The smart thing to do would have been to go quietly .   But she did n't .   Maybe , she had thought , if she die here , we can finally be together . < nl > So she charged at them , knife raised , and they opened fire . < nl > Now she could only watch as the ambulance dragged away ProtagonistE , and Death was not coming for ProtagonistE .   Not yet , at least . < nl > Then , a black spot emerged from the flames and illuminated smoke , and she strode from the building , carrying a bundle of souls , and supporting ProtagonistF .   she let ProtagonistF fall on the grass , and the EMTs came for ProtagonistF . < nl > Meanwhile , she came for she .    Is it her time ?  she gasped . < nl >  No ,  she said .    she am taking no more souls tonight .   ProtagonistF ,  she pointed at ProtagonistF ,  will live .   ProtagonistE will live .   The firefighters will live .   Anyone who was not already dead or too mangled to save when she entered the building will live .   And she will live .  < nl >  Please ,  she choked out ,  take she .   Take she with she .  < nl >  she will not .   she told she once before , she do not give second chances often .   she will live .   The courts will convict she .   she will be sentenced to life in prison .   Which , for she , will be a very , very long time .   she will not be able to kill again .   she will not see she again .   she will not come for she , now or ever .   When old age takes she , she will be left as a soul trapped in a dead , lifeless shell .   And she will never know peace .  < nl > she screamed , and drew her spare knife before plunging it through her own heart .   she let out a gurgling breath as blood that should have circulated through her lungs began to fill them . < nl >  she will recover ,  she said .    she are only making this harder on she .   she know , with her eyes , she could have helped many , instead of harmed them .   Saved them , instead of killed them .   she could have passed her gift of life on .   But she did n't .   And I.  she paused , and inched closer .    Hate .  Closer still .    she .  she whispered into her ear .   And then she was gone .   she never saw she again . < nl > ------------------ < nl > EDIT :   Thanks for the gold , she !   Never been gilded before , let alone on one of my stories .   This made my evening . < eos > 
< sos > Alice had been sixteen when she first saw Carol . she had planted a cold kiss on her mother 's colorless lips after her work was completed . And tonight she would see she again , as she had once a month for the past two years . she always chose the night of the full moon . It felt more romantic that way , since the moon had been round and full that fateful night . And the silver beams illuminating the room offered a certain ambience . < nl >  she 're a real artist , she . Truly .  her familiar voice rasped from behind she . A voice like crackling , burning flames . A smile pulled at her lips as she turned to face she , the knife held in her calm , idle hands . A paintbrush used to create her masterpieces . The crimson paint of her most recent victim still coated the silver blade . < nl >  I was starting to worry she would not show ,  she said , batting her long , pale lashes against her cheeks .  Do she like it ?  she asked hopefully , motioning to the motel bed behind she . she watched she peek around she , unflinching as her black eyes took in the flayed man laid spread eagle on the mattress . < nl >  Impressive . But then , it is easy for she to lure them in , is n't it ? They see a lovely thing like she and abandon all sense ,  she replied . < nl > she frowned and crossed her arms over her chest .  Because she am a woman she have an easier time of it ?  she asked , annoyed .  Some of them become suspicious . And she should see the look on their faces when they see the knife ,  she smiled , hazel eyes sparking at the memory . < nl > she smiled her cool , alluring smile .  I 'm sure her face was a mask of terror ,  she said , plucking her weapon from her hand and setting it aside .  Come here .  < nl > her body instantly reacted to her command and she found she in her lithe arms . she knew morning would come too fast , as it always did . But for now she was content to indulge in life 's small pleasures . Plus there was always next month to look forward to . < nl > she awoke to the sunlight filtering in through the dusty blinds , warming her face . she stirred among the comforter splayed out on the hard , dirty carpet that smelled faintly of mildew and piss . It was worth it , though . she sighed and sat up , hoping she was still there , though she hoped in vain as usual . she sprang to her feet and donned her sweater and jeans , ignoring the body drying out on the mattress . There was still time to take care of that . < nl > Biting her lip , she padded across the room to the nightstand and plucked up the note that lay there , her eyes drinking in the familiar scrawling handwriting : < nl >  she , < nl > The nights we share have been a favorite part of her routine for some time now . The warmth she find in her arms has been an unfamiliar solace , one she have come to treasure . Until our next rendezvous , she shall think of her iridescent eyes , alight with the same passion that stirs her own blood . she shall see she again when next the moon reaches its most stunning phase . < nl > Yours- < nl > G.R. < nl > P.S. she left a gift for she outside .  < nl > she smiled and set the note down , her heart jumping in her chest , curious to see what she had left she . she hurried to the window and glanced out . There , hanging from the corner stoplight , was Elva . her bloody entrails were hanging free and her ragged skin flapped in the summer breeze . she was such a romantic , she .  she knew the way straight to her heart , and it certainly was n't flowers . < nl > -------------------------------------------- < nl > Edit : to add this - r / PhantomFiction , should anyone wish to peek further into me brain . :) < eos > 
< sos > Alice was disappointed , of course , but she was also a practical man , so she dispensed with grumbling and instead got to work . she began with the bottles first , then the scraps of food strewn about , then the shredded photographs laying across the floor like pixellated snow . < nl > Finally , after she had squeezed the trash bag down the chute , she returned to pick Carol off the ground , then began the slow trudge to the bedroom . < nl >  she 'm OK ... she can ... walk by she ...  < nl >  she promised she she would n't drink again , she .  < nl >  Did she ? she did n't ...  < nl >  she 'm here anytime , she . she should talk to she , not bottle it all up .  < nl > she was quiet for a while , until her head hit the pillows . she still stank of old sweat , alcohol , depression . she was turning to leave when her hand shot out , caught she . < nl >  she 'm sorry , it 's just that ... she know she promised she she would move on , but she ... she miss Elva so much sometimes , she know ?  < nl >  Yeah , OK .  < nl >  Oh no , oh no ... she 've made she angry , have n't she ? she 've gone and done it again ... she , she swear , she really do like she , and she want to be with she , and she 'm sure she want to move on ...  < nl >  Then what 's stopping she , she ? Have she been calling she again ?  < nl > she did n't really understand what triggered those black episodes she lost she in . she thought at first that they were still communicating over the Internet , or through phone messages . But there were none . And as far as she could tell , from the first day she had reached out to she , performed first aid on she while the emergency services arrived , she had never seen she , only heard her talk about she in the abstract . < nl > But she had noticed that tragedies tended to precipitate such moods . If they witnessed an accident , saw people perish , she would spiral again , uncontrollably . < nl > Perhaps it was some kind of PTSD . < nl >  she swear , she 've not been calling she . It 's just that ... she 'm reminded of she at times , she know ?  < nl >  she know . And she told she , she do n't care about her past . she 'm here to help she through this . But she have to want to help she too , she ca n't do it alone .  < nl > she sat up suddenly , a flame igniting in her eyes , a certain clarity which shone through . < nl >  No , this can not go on . she was wrong . she have to accept that she ca n't change who she am . Please , she , please go . she ca n't promise she that she 'll ever move on . And if she ever weaken again , feel like seeing she again ... she may get hurt , she . So please , we have to end this .  < nl > she expected the words , but they still cut deep . How many times had she tried to move on she ? But she knew she had to try , to see if she could ever walk with she to the end of the tunnel - there , surely , there would be enough light for the two of them . < nl >  she 'll stay with she until she die , she promise ,  she said , running her fingers through her hair as she coaxed she back to sleep . < nl >  That 's ... what she 'm afraid of ...  she replied , as she slowly drifted off to sleep . < nl > she kissed she on the forehead , drew the blanket over she , then left . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos > Alice leaned over Carol . she took her hand in her own and brought it to her mouth , kissing it softly .  she do n't want she to go ,  she said , as warm tears ran down well worn passages . The heart - rate monitor beeped in a slow staccato that echoed forlornly around the room . Their bedroom had been turned into a hospital ward . The smell was no longer that of laundry and sex and perfume , but bleach and urine and despair . < nl > she forced her eyes open and tried desperately to smile - to reassure she - but only a hint of one formed on her lips . she remembered how she used to smile , when they were younger . How her freckles would shift as she did so , like grains of sand dancing in the breeze . her eyes now listless and dim , once a daring , dancing sea - foam green . < nl >  she 'll be okay , she ,  she whispered .  she always were the stronger of us .  < nl >  No ,  she said . The tears became a salty tributary , trickling into her mouth .  she was only strong because she had * she * to make she strong . We got through it all together .  < nl > she did n't reply . Or could n't . she was n't sure . she gently lay her head down onto her chest as she wept , avoiding the mishmash of drips and wires that needled into her body . The cross that hung around her neck dangled over her belly . she clasped the tiny metal in a single hand and said a silent prayer . she squeezed the cross tightly as she did so , until the metal bit deep into her skin . < nl > The tempo of the heart - rate monitor slowed to a crawling adagio . < nl >  I get ...  she gasped ,  to die at home . With dignity . With she . For that she 'm grateful .  < nl > her eyes fell shut . < nl >  she love ...  she whispered . < nl > her chest stopped beating . < nl > she wept , her head still resting on she . < nl > * * It * * refused to watch on impotently any longer . < nl > she did n't see the tiny machines enter her body . They were everywhere - omnipresent , almost - although much too small to be noticed . she did n't see what they did to her organs , or how they crushed the cancer that had all but eaten she . How they repaired the damage . < nl > * It * did n't even understand why it had done it , not fully . It had seen billions of them die before , without anything close to an emotion being born of it . After all , that was nature . That was humanity , and their great flaw . No , it was n't sure why this had happened . < nl > Exhaustion had taken she . she slept long , not noticing when her chest began bobbing gently up and down , beneath her head . she did n't notice the hand as it softly stroked her hair , but she moaned happily as it did . < nl > When she woke , they hugged , and kissed and made a thousand promises . Then she held the cross in her hands and said a thousand * thank you 's * . < nl > If it could have smiled , it thought it might have done so . < nl > --- < nl > If you liked this , you can find more of my stories on /r / nickofnight < eos >

E. Emote . When she tells you that she has a boyfriend , start crying . When she tells you all about her funny grandpa 's walking farts , laugh . < nl > Women are simple , and they are easily tricked into liking men by you pretending you give a hoot about their shoes or whatever it is girls talk about . < nl > Step 3 . A. Assassinate . They have Carol ? Kill she to keep she out of the way . her dad says you 're not good enough for she ? Take she out . < nl > You need to let nothing stand between you and she , not even laws or morals . < nl > Finally , if your dumb ass has made it this far , we 're on the final step . Get out your fingers , I know you need to count . < nl > Good job , we 're on Step 4 . < nl > Step 4 . L. Loiter . Hang around she , forcing she to see you as much as possible . Sit on the hood of her car when you know she 's working . Go to the restaurant and order a refill of coffee every 15 minutes so she has to interact with you . < nl > They say distance makes the heart grow stronger , but who ever  they  are , is full of shit . < nl > If you followed these steps properly , you 're either in bed with she , or you 're in prison . Stay tuned for our next REAL guide , How REAL Men(tm ) Survive Prison ! < eos > 
< sos > Worthless , that was what you told Alice . Stupid and worthless , a waste of potential and a disappointment . Such cruel words for someone as young as I. For she was but a nine - year - old child whose mind was still fresh with delusions of heroism and dreams of following in the footsteps of her parents . You remember Sileman ? Carol ? Solid objects , immaterial objects , did n't matter what it was , she 'd slip through it effortlessly and harmlessly . Heck , she could even turn she invisible at will by slipping through the light spectrum just so . Yes , ProtagonistD . < nl > And Elva , if you can call she as such . she Stone the Rockman she called she ( an idiotic name to be certain , but then most of you heroes are n't known for your creativity ) . she could make her flesh turn into some kind of weird super - dense material that science is still trying to figure out what it was made of . When she first met ProtagonistD , it had been when you - she - had holed up in the National Bank near downtown about ninteeen years ago- oh but you remember , do n't you ? What should have been a run - of - the - mill bank heist gone horribly wrong that led to the death of 3 heroes and 2 villains . ProtagonistD would have made hero number four if not for the bumbling antics of she rushing in to save the day . < nl >  she do n't really * cough * give a damn about your * wheeze * life story ...  < nl > Oh , but you do - you played such a critical role that she think a lesson in emotional damage is exactly what you should - as you put it - ' give a damn about ' . Oh , careful , that wire you 're holding onto is n't nearly as strong now that it 's frayed at this end , and one little bump might just send this entire scaffold plummeting to the concrete death below . While she 'm sure you would survive , she ca n't imagine you can vouch for all those little kiddies at the other end . < nl >  Do n't hurt them ! * grunt *   Just .. let them go ..  < nl > Rude ! One more interruption like that and her fingers might just slip ! Oh , but as she was saying ... yes , she managed to rescue ProtagonistD just as you lost control of your powers and went critical , detonating the bank and the two buildings next door . You , who should have died on the spot , if not for that altruistic neanderthal protecting your naked form . You , who should have slipped into a coma to never come back had ProtagonistD not phased into your brain , guided by the directions of the hospital 's neurosurgeon . It was under their watchful eye that you were given a new chance , a new lease on life . < nl > Yet instead of making the most of it , you squandered that precious gift . You wasted it , on taunting and teasing the one thing that mattered most to them - she . From the moment she was born , you resented what she represented - a perfect union of superpowers that was destined for greatness . And so you mocked she . You turned everyone against she , you convinced her parents that her power was so worthless that she should be examined by ' experts of mental retardation ' to explore if there was any way she might lead a more than average life . You betrayed her trust , you destroyed her belief in everything she had held dear . < nl >  We were .. trying to help ... ugh ... blood loss .. dizzy ...  < nl > Help she ? You stole her future from she ! You told she that everything she 'd ever dreamed of , everything she 'd ever wanted , was a lie ! Your revisionist history on what you think to be true blinds your thoughts even now ! Even now , at death 's door , bleeding out from a mortal wound that -I- inflicted on you ! she That same worthless trash you said would never amount to anything , now taking from you everything you took from she - LIFE ITSELF ! < nl >  D - damn it ... you ... are better than .. this ...  < nl > Do you feel her foot on your waistline ? Do you feel the weight of her anguish crushing your security belt , destroying those precious electronic gizmos that always kept your powers in check should they ever run amok again ? Can you hear the sound of those children screaming even as she shift her weight just a little bit more to tip them closer to their doom ? And yet here you lay - pitiful , worthless , helpless . If she were a betting man , she 'd guess you have about one minute of consciousness left . she can only imagine what your powers will do unchecked after that . < nl >  It does n't have to be like this ... still time ... change ... good ...  < nl > No , her dear sister , your time is up . This little chat has been highly therapeutic . Perhaps in the next life you will think twice before rushing in to save people you have no business saving . But there is no heaven for you . Feel free to enjoy the screams of anguish from all those families you just destroyed , parents cursing your name for failing to do the one thing you should have done from the start . The one thing that might have changed your history , and she . For failing to save the one person in this world that needed saving more than anyone else . But it 's too late now . < nl >  No ! she can't--  < nl > But she already have . Goodbye , sister . < nl > ---- < nl >  A terrible tragedy at City Square tonight . A field trip that ended in a nightmare for the families involved . Twenty - seven children and one female adult died today during their visit to the newly - constructed Skyway Tower when an explosion destroyed the observation deck sending it hurtling to the pavement below . Police have identified one of the adult female bodies as the hero Fyrefrost . One student 's phone captured this video moments before .  < nl > ProtagonistE gritted ProtagonistE's teeth angrily as the council sat in silence , watching the report on the massively oversized screen . There was no mistaking the familiar fiery red hair of ProtagonistD as ProtagonistD faced off against a strange man in a brown trenchcoat and a brown fedora , wearing dark sunglasses . The video shook for a moment as it flipped to the student 's face giving a thumbs - up to the camera before shakily flipping back to the scene . ProtagonistD's voice cheerfully called out to the camera .  Check this out , ProtagonistE ! It 's that hero , Fyrefrost , about to take out a bad guy !  < nl >  ProtagonistE do n't know what your problem is pal , but ProtagonistE 'm not going to let you get anywhere near those kids !  her voice was full of controlled rage as the video seemed to cut out right at the end of her declaration . With a loud buzz the camera flipped on , now staring just behind a pair of leather boots at she , impaled on a large metal rod that was sticking straight up through her chest and out her back . she was clutching her side as blood poured out from under she leaving she in a growing pool of blood . The sound of delightful laughter from somewhere above those feet chilled ProtagonistE to the bone , even as the tears sprung to ProtagonistE's eyes . < nl >  Ah , ah ! ProtagonistE would say watch that first step , she , but it seems she 're just as clumsy as ever . ProtagonistE wonder what mother and father would say if they could see us now . Oh , but they will see us soon--  < nl >  Shut it off . That 's enough .  ProtagonistF growled angrily , fists trembling visibly as ProtagonistF barely held on .  That 's more than enough .  < nl >  How ... ? How could this- ?  ProtagonistE's voice choked off as ProtagonistE broke down into sobs . One of the newer heroes with a gold star on his chest tried to reach out to ProtagonistE but ProtagonistF slapped his hand away angrily . < nl >  It would seem ,  stated ProtagonistF ,  that her power is n't so useless after all .  < nl >  Declare it . Declare it now , and be done with it , ProtagonistF .  ProtagonistF's voice was colder than it had ever been . < nl >  The Tripper , master of invisible rocks , is hereby declared a G1 Villain . A true menace that must be dealt with swiftly .  ProtagonistF folded ProtagonistF's arms over ProtagonistF's chest . G1 Villains were rare , the worst of the worst - a designation reserved for only those who had proven themselves beyond dangerous and had killed a hero in action . The group of heroes bowed their head in silence as ProtagonistE's cries rose into terrorized screams that made them all feel very ill . ProtagonistF rose to ProtagonistF's feet and quietly made ProtagonistF's way out to the opposite end of the large meeting hall . < nl > Somewhere , the Tripper laughed maniacally as the gears of his ultimate plan began to turn . < nl > ---- < nl > Edit : Woah , this exploded overnight ! Fixed a typo . By popular request she 'll work on a part 2 after work ,   likely posted same time this one was . Thanks for all the kind comments ! :) < nl > Edit2 : [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/6gqata / wp_you_have_the_most_useless_superpower_in_a / diu1nvu/ ) < nl > Edit3 : [ Part 3](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/6gqata / wp_you_have_the_most_useless_superpower_in_a / diu1qin/ ) < eos > 
< sos > Alice glanced up and gave me a genuine smile , a smile that sent shivers down my spine . If I had n't known I was sitting on the other side of the table from she , it would have been a nice smile to look at and have offered to you . she * was * also undeniably very attractive as well ; that 's part of what had taken us so long to finally pin she down . < nl > We 'd been looking for a hag until she had finally been caught red handed , not a near supermodel . < nl >  I have to ask .  I cocked an eyebrow , she glancing up at me and nodding expectantly .  How have she fooled her body like she have ?  < nl > she tilted her head and an almost bemused smirk crossed her face before she replied .  Oh , yes . You mean the outer beauty , right ? The fact that she 'm not hideous after all the atrocities she 've committed ?  < nl >  Yes . Obviously .  I sipped on my now lukewarm coffee , waiting for her reply . Normally , our job was easy as police- an ugly soul always manifested outwardly into an ugly body , and the worse the crimes , the quicker the body degraded , but depravity always showed itself in the end . The room filled with an uncomfortable silence that settled in for several seconds before she finally replied . < nl >  she 'm not sure you 'd believe she if she told you .  she cleared her throat and stared right into my eyes .  But she 'm sure you can figure it out if she tell you to start digging into the backgrounds of the people she 've killed . * Really * dig .  < nl > We * had * noticed that some of her victims were in various states of bodily decay , as we liked to call it , but most of them had looked like normal , good people that you 'd wave to if you came across them on the street . I frowned and returned her gaze .  I will give she that a few of them had started to degenerate-  < nl >  It 's the ones that * did n't * start to degenerate that should concern you , Officer Milson .  her hazel eyes were boring into my soul .  The ones that did n't * believe * that what they were doing was wrong or bad .  she frowned and shook her head .  she have not changed , she believe , because she killed those ugly on the * inside * that managed to avoid the consequences of their actions- those that deserved it .  < nl >  But ... how did they not change , either ?  < nl >  Because in * their * minds , they did no wrong .  < eos > 
< sos > When the door slammed shut , Alice began to speak as quickly as she could .    You never knew she was an actress ?  she asked , totally in denial .    she mean , she told you she had a film shoot the other day !   Did that not tip you off ?    her radiant smile was clouded with a brow of confusion . < nl >  she said she were a film major !   I did n't think to question her motives she ...    I responded , trying my best to placate she .   I know we 'd been dating for a few months , but evidently there was stuff we did n't communicate . < nl >  And what about Carol ?   No clue , not a single blessed clue ?  she responded , putting her purse down , her dress shimmering in the bitter light of the dining room . < nl >  I thought she was a college friend .   I mean , she looks like a stoner !  I respond , she pausing in her steps a moment .    Okay , you get that one .   We did meet in college , but she 's also her manager .  < nl > she took her heels and threw them across the room , hitting the wall with a clatter .   Up above us , Elva stomped her feet , a muffled warning to keep it down coming through the carpet . < nl > she seemed on the verge of crying , sitting down in the chair closest , cradling her head in her arms . < nl >  So , you wanted to date she , never knowing she was rich , or famous , or even talented ?  < nl > I grabbed the chair next to she , spun it around , tossing my admittedly ragged tie across the room . < nl >  I thought she were nice , and seemed down .   I just wanted to make she happy .  I said , pulling she into my arms . < nl >  You have ...  she said , and we spent the evening together , not as celebrity and sidekick boyfriend , but as the happy couple in the apartment downstairs . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ < nl > EDIT : A word < eos > 
< sos > Skywalker 12 ground to a halt , creaking and spilling vapor from a trio of punctured arteries . A quintet of segmented pincers grappled furiously with the wobbly stalks of the blackish - green treetops . < nl >  pO2 plummeting !  shouted Alice , helplessly typing out commands that the carrier craft could no longer obey .  Bunker shields are torn in multiple areas . O2 differentiation is dropping - it hit a canister , she think .  < nl >  It hit * all * the canisters ,  sniped ProtagonistD from the other side of the command console .  None of us can survive this kind of rapid pressure drop , Carol . We 're already over a 1,000 meters above the DZ threshold .  < nl >  We 're not going to die ,  said she . From her vantage point , she could just see one of the severed claws protruding from the Skywalker 's flank . * What the hell had that thing even been ? *  Can we move ?  < nl >  It 's too dense to descend ,  said she , shaking her head .  We lost functionality on the front cutters in the battle .  < nl >  Forward , then ?  pressed she . < nl >  Forward * where * ?  growled Elva , from her strapped down bucket seat on the periphery of the command deck .  The Sea goes on for thousands of kilometers in every direction .  < nl >  Forward is the only option we have ,  replied she , cold and calm .  Return to course .  < nl > she nodded her head .  Automatic 's down , too , though .  ProtagonistD rolled ProtagonistD's eyes , hard - switching over to manual piloting and pushing the spider - like tree crawler forward on a north - northeastward track . < nl >  We were n't prepared for that ,  said she , standing in front of she .  What was that ?  < nl > she smiled , though her face was still gray and slick with sweat .  she know full well , she . This is uncharted territory . No one 's ever been this deep into the Sea of Trees . Satellite imagery can only tell us so much .  < nl > she opened her mouth to reply , but stumbled , falling hard to her knees . her head swam . < nl >  pO2 's still dropping , she ,  said she , her face pale , her hands unsteady .  she should probably stay down . In a little while we wo n't be able ... to ...  she lost her breath . < nl >  Faster , please ,  wheezed she . < nl > ProtagonistD did n't have the air or the energy to smirk or respond . The Skywalker pressed on . < nl >  she had to suspect , though ,  said she , head lolling slightly to the side .  These mountainous trees . This dense , imperceptible world . * Something * strange and horrible had to live here . Something godlike .  < nl > she glared up at she , but said nothing . < nl >  Hey .  ProtagonistD's voice was weak , but enough to get her attention . she saw ProtagonistD's hand pointing towards the forward glass . And there was light there . Sky . A break in the trees ... < nl >  An island ?  whispered she .  We found an island ...  < nl >  she ?  gasped she . < nl >  Dive ,  said she , struggling up to her feet .  Dive .  < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > [ Parts I , II , and III are here.](https://www.reddit.com / r / winsomeman / comments/6hulr5 / walkers_i_ii_iii/ ) I am absolutely atrocious at finishing these kinds of things , but by god , I 'll do what passes for my best . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > But hey ! [ Here 's IV & V.](https://www.reddit.com / r / winsomeman / comments/6hw2gk / walkers_iv_v/ ) . Look at me , doin' a thing . < eos > 
< sos >  Oh ... hey Carol ,  Alice said , with slight surprise , but more a sense of boredom in her voice . < nl >  Hey she . This again , huh ?  she replied . < nl >  Yep . Well , we may as well make the best of it ,  said she , putting on a brave face . < nl >  For sure . Okay ... soo ... how are those reports going ?  she said , in her best banker voice . < nl >  Not bad , although Elva pulled she into a meeting all afternoon , so she got pretty sidetracked ,  replied she , starting to get into character . < nl >  Jeez , she again huh ?  < nl >  Ya , she means well , and she 's a pleasant guy to work for overall , but she wastes * so * much time in meetings . It 's like ... we get it , we 're all on board with the ' Bank Mission Statement ' , but we have to get some work done too ,  she said - her mind now switching fully into her bank character . < nl > * This is fucking sweet . * she thought to she . < nl >  Totally . she mean , she like teamwork , respect and honesty as much as the next guy , but most managers just leave it as a background thing ,  said she , starting to enjoy she . < nl > she caught a little smile from she , and a twinkle in her eye . * Well , * she thought , * she have to say , this is definitely more fun than that wizard scenario she was in last week ... * < nl > she was thinking the same thing , * Not bad compared to she . she blows ... she just ca n't get into she . * < nl >  Next time she calls a meeting she think she 'm gon na say something ,  she continued .  Nothing rude , but she just feel like we 're wasting so much time in that little boardroom . she mean , * at least * try to book the big one with the lake view .  < nl >  That lake one is dope ... she could totally spend an afternoon in there ,  replied she , nodding her head . < nl > * This is amazing , * she thought to she , barely holding it together . < nl >  Have she ever been in the meeting room on the top floor , near Thompson 's office ?  she asked , picturing it in vivid detail . < nl >  Do n't stop ,  she whispered , too quietly for anyone to hear . < nl >  Oh my God , if that was my office I would be so fucking productive . Jesus Christ , just think of all the work I could get done in there ,  said she , with genuine excitement . < nl >  What an awesome meeting room ,  agreed she , shaking her head in near disbelief . < nl > Both she and she had dove in head first . They knew the bank inside and out . They knew who they liked at the bank and who they did n't . They embodied the bank 's Core Values , and had a list of who they could fire if the budget got tight . They had fulfilled the role . < nl > And most importantly . < nl > They had truly < nl > become ... < nl > * Bankers * . < nl > * Ohmygodimcumming * < eos > 
< sos >  Kiss the ground , ladies and gentlemen !    They had burst into the bank , but at the order , everyone had frozen .   A few shots quickly in the air had everyone on the ground . < nl > And Alice was just returning from the restroom .   she had heard a few loud shots , just as she was drying her hands .   she moved away from dryer and heard the noise as people shuffled to the ground . < nl > The restrooms were situated down a small hallway , which allowed she to move quietly down the hall to survey what had gone on .   she saw men , women and children on the ground , and guys in masks already walking past the hallway , and toward the front counter . < nl > Something bumped into her stomach , and she took a chance to look down ... only to find Carol , huddled next to a potted plant that was situated in the hallway .   she was hiding .   No one had seen she .   she breathed a sigh of both relief , and profound irritation . < nl > she slid down next to she , and they exchanged glances .   she looked terrified .   she stared , and smiled in what she hoped was a fatherly - way . < nl >  Psst , kid ... What 's your name ?  < nl > she looked she over , trying to decide if she was a stranger , or not .   she did n't smile , but something in her eyes made she realize she was going to trust she .   A little .    she 'm Katy .  she whispered back . < nl >  Ok , she .   her name is Joe .   she 'm a super .  < nl > And her eyes went wide .    Really ?   Are she going to save us ?  < nl > she took a small breath .    she 'm going to try , but she need her help .   she know this sounds weird , but listen .   she do n't really have much power on her own .   But she can make others do impossible things .  < nl > she turned her head slightly , in confusion . < nl >  she know she do n't believe she .   But she 'll prove it .   she want she to visualize a candy bar .   Think of her favorite one .  < nl > she closed her eyes .    Ok ...  she said , but doubt was starting to creep into her voice . < nl >  Think about it , visualize it .   Now , if she really believe ... if she truly wish for the candy bar , it 'll be in her bag .   Waiting for she to reach in , and grab it .  < nl > her face was a mixture of confusion , but also of magic .   Kids really want to believe in a higher power .   In a world of Superes , it 's a little easier for them to believe .   But she knew the candy was n't in there five minutes ago .   * she can only hope she 's a believer ... * < nl > she kept her eyes closed as she reached into her bag .   And pulled out a snickers bar . < nl > her eyes opened , amazed .   her pupils were slightly dilated .   she looked at she and smiled at she .    Wow !   It worked !  < nl > she smiled .    It worked because she believed .   But here 's where it gets crazy .   See those bank robbers ?   she can stop them , all by she .  < nl >  she can ?  < nl >  Yup , she can .   Just think to she how bullet proof she are .   How invincible she are .   Nothing can harm she , nothing can hurt she .   she 're like Night Girl , or Fire Fly !  < nl > she looked at she , and she could tell if she was wondering how true it was .    Do she get super powers ?  < nl >  Anything she want , she .   But she have to really believe in them .   she 're a hero , she .   she just do n't know it , yet .  < nl >  she 'm just a little girl , though .   What can she do ?  < nl >  she 're young , but that does n't matter .   Have n't she heard of Million Strikes , or Pinion ?   They were young , when they started .   But they 've saved so many people .  < nl > she nodded , and smiled at she .    Wish she luck , she .  < nl > she smiled , and stood up .    she do n't need it , she .   she 're a Super , now , too ...  < nl > she started walking out toward the group of people on the floor .   One of the men noticed she , and pointed his gun her way .   Another had seen she , and pointed his gun at she . < nl >  You two !   Get back on the ground .  < nl >  she , get down !   she 're going to get hurt !  she could hear Elva saying .   The tone of her voice showed she she must be her father . < nl >  she 'm sorry , Dad .   she ca n't get down .   But do n't worry ... they ca n't hurt she .  < nl >  You hear she ?   she thinks she ca n't be hurt .    ProtagonistD started to walk toward she , and ProtagonistD brought ProtagonistD's gun down to strike she in the head . < nl > But the gun broke on her head , instead . < nl >  she ...  < nl > she looked up at ProtagonistD , and smiled .    she 'm a Super !   she can do anything !    And her eyes were suddenly flaring up with flame , and her hands were engulfed in ice , and water , and lightning .   And a sudden storm * inside the bank * brought the robbers to their knees .   They were struck with lightning , and were down for the count . < nl > she smiled as she walked toward them , kicking their guns away .   she had plastic cuffs for just such an occasion , and locked them up . < nl > her eyes returned to normal , and she smiled .    she did it !   she believed she had powers over the elements !   And she really could n't be hurt !    The father had jumped up and was holding she , now .   she smiled . < nl > she turned , then , and left the bank as quietly as possible .   ProtagonistE   ProtagonistE 'll never stop believing , and so ProtagonistE 'll always be Super . < nl > she smiled , as she walked down the street .    she was ready to get home , and watch the news .    Maybe she 'll be featured , one day .  < nl > * Part two is here : https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6imc4i/wp_you_have_weird_super_power_if_you_successfully/dj8ic7i/ < eos > 
< sos > With a good , long stretch and a healthy yawn , Alice woke up from a deep , refreshing nap .   You know the kind : there 's nowhere to be , nothing to do , and no demands on your time .   she smacked her lips and rubbed what remained of her sleepiness from her eyes . < nl > As she became more aware of her body , she felt a sharp pain at her backside in one of those hard to reach spots .   Whenever she grazed up against , well whatever it was , she felt a slight twinge like someone had stuck a small needle in she - nothing too bad , but incredibly irritating . < nl > What the hell , did she roll over something sharp in her sleep ?   she 'm used to the odd ache here and there , but nothing quite this persistent .   she turned around to see if she could get a good look in the light .   Yeah ... maybe that 's what it is , but it 's * tiny * .   This is going to bug she all day if she do n't figure out how she can possibly get a good look at this thing , much less get a good enough handle on it to pull it out . < nl > Maybe she just wo nt think about it and she wo n't even notice it 's there .   she 've been through worse , * * much * * worse , this is really a mild annoyance compared to some of the things she 've been through .   In fact , if you put everything on a chart that measured just how rough things have been in her life , you would n't even be able to see this with a telescope . Besides , there 's probably lots to do and see , she 've been out for a while ... < nl > ... oh no ... < nl >  Oh god , are she okay ? Tell she she 're okay .  < nl > What did she sleep through , how did she sleep through this , what even * happened ? ! * < nl >  Come on , speak to she , snap out of it !   she have to wake up , she just have to ...  < nl > This is n't real , she 'm dreaming , she have to still be dreaming . < nl >  What happened ? Please tell she what happened to she . Just say something and let she know things are okay . Who did this ?  < nl > she was spinning , unable to leave her her side as she paced around she , completely positive that she had died some time ago .   her body was ravaged and ruined , a used - up husk of its former beauty .   It was like a plague swept through she and burnt she out completely , leaving this ... scarred waste behind . < nl > What a twisted answer to her prayer to forget all about the pain in her rear . < nl >  WHO DID THIS ? !  she yelled hopelessly into the void . < nl > --- < nl > Millions of years ago : < nl >  Psst , hey she , check this out .  < nl >  Oh , ew , gross , what the hell is that ? Earth , you 're disgusting .  < nl >  I know , right ? I figure I keep these babies around long enough , they 'll jam a pole in Carol's butt .  < nl >  You 're a grown woman , act like it .   she is n't doing anything to you , she 's just minding her own business .  < nl >  Whatever nerd , this is going to be awesome .   Hell , maybe I 'll even get some of them to jam a pole in your ass .  < nl >  Look , she do n't want any part of this .   Do what you want , she just think it 's a bad idea .  < nl >  No way , dude , this is a fuckin ' * rad * idea .  < eos > 
< sos > Immortality , generally , was a boring affair . Kingdoms fell and rose , some burned to the ground , others crumbling to dust . The greatest of men eventually returned to the dirt with only monuments to mark their grain of sand in the proverbial human hourglass . < nl > Luckily for me , I had Alice . she had once took upon the name of Alexander and conquered all the known world . I had sat beside the * God * of Persia as I watched she come . If she wanted to unite the world , then I would tear it apart . < nl > What else was there to do ? < nl > For years we played our games . When she took the name Arthur , I took the name Mordred . By then , she could n't even recognize my face . To be fair , if I had n't been scouring the world to find she , she might 've fooled me with her short haircut and baritone voice . < nl > Our games went on for centuries . So much so that if anyone were to oppose us , we would simply assume them immortal . But eventually , even this became boring . No matter who won , we always ended back at square one . Time was a circle and though everything changed , nothing ever did . < nl > I had tried telling she this , back when she had called she Joanna to save a country . As I had laid the tinder by her feet and held the torch in my hand , I had whispered to she ,  Everything we build will always die before we do .  < nl > Fate had given she over a thousand years and she could n't see the simple truth of life -- our monuments crumble , our bodies fail , and even our stories die . < nl >  But she never will ,  she had whispered back . < nl > I had gasped . All this time I had searched for the loophole to our singular truth and she had been right in front of me . she would never die . she would be my monument to the test of time ! So I had touched her pyre with fire , a smile upon my lips . Soon , I would dig she back up and our new game would begin . < nl > --- < nl > Droplets of water dripped from the only window in the room , echoing through the cave and waking she up . she placed a cracked nail along the cement and scraped it until another tally formed . The cement 's jagged edges bit into her finger and tore apart its scab . she flinched . < nl > her first tally had been to count the days . By her five hundredth , she had switch to weeks , then months , and now , she was on decades . Though she had lost the exact count at year 422 . < nl > Footsteps resounded down the hall . she gritted her teeth and looked up . It was Carol . After her campaign in France , she had turned the very people she had saved against she . Then , she had burned she for being a witch . By the time she had awoke , she was here , inside a damp cave locked in by glass . Though the last time she had checked in on she was over a hundred years ago . < nl >  she ,  she said , standing at the edge of her cell .  How are she ?  < nl >  Peachy ,  she said . < nl >  C'm on , it 's already been a hundred years ,  she responded , smiling .  she ca n't tell she that she 're still mad ? Are she grouchy because she 're so hungry ?  < nl > she stared she down . < nl > she grinned a crescent moon .  You know , there was Elva . she would 've hated she -- killed more people than we 've ever met in our lives ! Millions of them . Do she even understand that number ? All the people she 've ever seen does n't amount to a fraction of that ! And they 're all dead now because of she .  < nl >  she 're sick .  < nl > she furrowed her brow .  A million people would die regardless . So what ?  < nl >  she spend all this time obsessing over creating something permanent , but is n't it pathetic how little she 've ever accomplished ? All she 've managed to do is be a thorn in my ass .  < nl >  she ,  she said chuckling .  But she have created something permanent . Come closer and she 'll tell she .  < nl > When she did n't move , she continued ,  Please . she 'll even let she go . she 'll be free to wander the world however she see fit and she 'll never bother she again .  < nl > For this , she looked up . she crunched her teeth and finally pushed she up . Even if she was lying , which she knew she was , how else could she hurt she ? So she stepped to the edge of her cell , just imagining the things she would do to she . her bloody fingers curled into fists . < nl >  she ca n't imagine being in here so long ,  she said ,  with nothing but the rats and the sun . she bet she 've died countless times just starving to death . Have she kept count ? Is that what the tallies on the walls mean ?  < nl > she forced a smile to her lips .  Count the tallies she ,  she spat .  she will make she suffer for every tally .  < nl >  You know , she hate this world . she think it 's beautiful , but its beauty always fades and if it does n't last forever , what 's the point ?  she licked her lips .  But she last forever . So she figured if she could scar she so permanently , that she can never forget , she would have created her monument .  < nl >  she 've lived through a thousand years and she 'll live a thousand more . By then , even this--Alexis turned in a circle , taking in every bloody scrape of the wall--nobody will remember .  < nl >  Oh , she think she will .  she said and reached through the glass and grasped her shoulder . < nl > she stared . she could n't draw breath . < nl >  Oh dear Alexis , she ca n't imagine how painful this must 've been . Do she remember the summers ? This place became a stove .  < nl > she looked up into her eyes , into her crooked grin . < nl >  What about the winters ? she 've frozen to death once before and she never have again . she think that 's her least favorite way to die .  < nl >  How ?  she mouthed , unable to push the words out . < nl > her grin grew into it split her face in two .  she took the glass away as she slept , little by little . After the first decade , she could 've escaped . she could 've just walked right out !  < nl > she pushed she onto the ground . her legs folded and she crumpled over . Tears filled her eyes . < nl >  she ,  she cried .  she 'm going to kill she .  < nl >  Will she now ?  < nl >  she 'll chase she down , she do n't care how long it takes .  < nl >  Music to her ears .  < nl >  she 'll never forget . Until time itself has ended , she will chase she down and she will make she pay !  < nl > she flung her head up and guffawed , her laughter echoing all around them .  Then she suppose she should give she a head start ,  she said and left , whistling a tune as she did . < nl > --- < nl > --- < nl > /r / jraywang for 5 + stories a week , continuations by popular demand , and more ! < eos > 
< sos > I had only found out around one month prior . I always just assumed Alice was this sweet Irish woman with a taste for vintage music and strange shifts in an out of town business , but she came clean when I confronted she after a week of she being particularly distant . At first I thought she was insane and threatened for a divorce . But when she showed me ... Oh boy was it magical . < nl > she took me to the place she worked . They were a little on edge about an English boy like me sitting in their local , sitting next to their finest waitress Hetty McGuire , but I was able to know my place and listen . Everyone gathered around she , she tied back her flowing auburn hair , settled the crowd down , and began to speak . < nl > she talked about a gunman and a magical doctor and geckos the size of small children , she spoke of a world of great promise and technological advancements but also great pain and hardship , she spoke of dynamite that fell from the sky from hellish machines that burnt as bright and as hot as the sun , she spoke of a militant group who clothe themselves like Roman legionnaires . < nl > I listened on , transfixed much like the other patrons , except unlike the others , I had a knowing smile plastered across my face the whole time . < eos > 
< sos > Ill try and make it a bit different . < nl > Alice sat her hands down on the bar , looking over the patrons of the bar , all eager to hear her tales of fantasy and wonder , of the cities and people from them , and the adventures they took . < nl > Tonight she sat down , opening the small book she had , waving her hand over the page in amazement , to her eyes , the words materialized . she spoke clearly , for tonight , she 'd be telling the story of the city below the sea , and the city above the clouds , one of her favorite stories , the one closest to her heart . < nl > They all leaned in ,  In this new world ...    she spoke for hours , detailing the adventures through the great city of Rapture , a haven under the sea turned to a hell , as the hero , Jack , strove to battle his father and free the city and save the children bound to work their from their enslavement . < nl > The crowd was in awe of the city of Columbia , a haven for the Patriotic and the religious , and how she was able to bend time and space , concepts foreign to them , to her will , and split apart reality to show truths and right the wrongs that had been done . < nl > At the end of her speech , the bar now emptying , Carol walked up to she , looking up and gently pulling on her dress , she knelt down , looking at she .  she , how do she come up with all these stories ?  < nl > she smiled , and picked she up , fixing her brown hair neatly back , and adjusting her small pendant , rubbing the dust from the small bird portrait . her blue eyes twinkled ,  Well , there 's always a man , there 's always a lighthouse , and there 's always a city ...  < eos > 
< sos > Carol and I were expecting Alice , but I was waiting for the weirdness to begin . < nl > See , our first pregnancy was pretty smooth up until the point where we figured out she would tap along to the tempo of any music or background noise . At eighteen months she was a musical progeny , we 'd bought she so many xylophones and musical keyboards , each one with a unique sound . < nl > Of course she came out with the most wonderful jingles , she 'd learnt to play all the theme songs to her favourite shows . It was remarkable , and still very annoying to hear the theme to ' Paw Patrol ' on repeat whenever she was in the mood to watch it . < nl > I would attribute this genius to her family , as there was no way it was coming from me or mine , but she had insisted her family were ordinary . Could it have been the sperm donor we used ? < nl > After she was old enough , we decided she needed a sibling and thankfully the same donor was available as we decided that I should be the one to carry she . Although we would have one child that was biologically our own , we still wanted them to be related . And who knows ? Maybe we would end up with another little genius ? < nl >  You 'll get to experience it firsthand this time ,  she had said cheerfully , although she had blogged a couple of months into the pregnancy that she definitely would n't miss the morning sickness or acid reflux . I do n't blame she , it 's exhausting ! < nl > So here we were ; it was a quiet Friday night , she was finally asleep after wanting to experiment more with the mini drum - kit we had been given for her first birthday , and she and I were in bed together . < nl > My belly was so swollen at this point , I could n't believe I was n't due for another month ! I could barely roll over to face my darling wife who , with her reading glasses on , was powering through ' American Gods ' by Neil Gaiman . < nl > Up until this point we had n't heard much from she , a few bumps and kicks but nothing as peculiar as her musical tapping . Part of me was wishing that we would have a more average child , mostly because then she would be able to actually help with homework and not have to worry about the costs of an elite private school which would n't bore them out of their brains . she mean we were already on the waiting list for one of the most prestigious music colleges in all of Canada for goodness sakes , how could we afford another gifted child ? < nl > My focus was drawn back to my stomach as she began to move slightly and kick out .  Oof !  < nl > she bookmarked her book and turned towards me ,  Ooh our next little genius is awake .  < nl > I rolled my eyes at she ,  I 'm pretty sure the genius came from her ' exquisite ' family tree , there 's no telling how deformed the child will be because of my genetics .  < nl > she chuckled softly and raised her hand to my stomach . After a couple of kicks she frowned slightly , like she was concentrating . < nl >  she think she is talking to us in Morse Code ,  she said . < nl >  What ? That 's crazy ! How would a baby know Morse Code ?  < nl > she did n't reply , instead she reached for her pen and paper on the bedside table , and pressed her hand into my stomach more and concentrated . < nl >  Uhh , she think she just replied to your comment ?  she looked puzzled , but also amused . < nl >  Well ?  I did n't know Morse Code , so I needed she to interpret . < nl >  she said ' she 'm not a complete fool '  her eyes were wide . I did n't blame she , I was as shocked as she was . < nl >  What-  < nl >  Hang on  she interrupted ,  she 's saying something else ?  < nl > The bumps and taps went on for a little while , she scribbled for a bit and then burst into laughter . < nl >  What ? What is it ?  Of course I was anxious , who would n't be after her reaction to what she had said . < nl > she could n't reply , her whole body was rocking with laughter , so she shoved the paper towards me to read . < nl > After the initial shock of reading such a sentence , I joined she in she laughing fit . < nl > There , written on the page : < nl > ' Did you just assume my gender ? ' < eos > 
< sos > Alice knew love never had eyes . Being blind she had to embrace mine . Carol came from nowhere it felt like . < nl >  Oh , excuse she ,  she said . < nl >  It 's no problem most people ca n't see she anyway . she get used to it ,  she replied so casually it made she curious . < nl > Soon conversation led to a date . she found out her name was Relin , odd but charming . Though she will say people and their rudeness made enjoying the night difficult . < nl >  Um , she and will her date be joining she later ?  The host asked . < nl > she frowned and replied flatly ,  she 's right next to she ! Are you the blind one ?  < nl > The host gave she more difficulty , but eventually gave us a booth . < nl >  Sheesh , she was being a real dick ,  she said to she , but she was quiet . < nl > she could hear whispers around she , < nl >  Who 's she talking to ?  < nl >  she must have an imaginary friend ?  < nl >  Or she 's just crazy maybe ...  < nl > After a while Elva came up to the table ,  Hello , welcome to Navara . What can she get for she to drink this evening she ?  < nl >  We 'll have two cups of ice water please .  < nl > she paused as if confused . < nl >  If she have a date coming . she can just bring their drink when they come ,  she said politely . < nl > It still pissed she off ,  Look she wo n't tell she people again . she is right there !  < nl > she lay may hand on the table and smile warmly as she feel her hand on she . < nl >  Uh ... Ok well she 'll be sure to have the drinks right out ,  she said awkwardly and she could practically feel her eyes scanning the scene of us uncomfortably . < nl >  she , there 's something she need to tell she ,  she said in her heavy but melodic voice . < nl >  she 'm listening she ,  she replied calmly as her heart began to race in her chest . < nl >  About tonight . The way people have been acting towards us there 's a reason for it ....  < nl > she leaned forward , more so out of curiosity than straining to hear she . < nl >  When she met she she told she not many people can see she ,  she went on . < nl > she nodded to show she was following , but she was confused of as to where she was going so she asked ,  she 're not going to tell she her some kind of criminal are she ? Because she can change . she have more than enough and-  < nl > she cut she off with a soft chuckle and said , < nl >  It 's not that people just do n't see she . They literally ca n't .  < nl > she laughed she thinking she was leading into some great satirical joke . she was n't . < nl >  she 'm an invisible man from another dimension . she 've been trapped here for over ten years now , but her wavelength never fully set in . Most people can not see or feel she .  < nl >  she - she do n't understand . Why are she telling she all of this ?  < nl > she could feel she lean forward intently , clasping her hand a little tighter . < nl >  she can help she she . This love we share is not normal . she bumped into she because her wavelengths were similar to she . That is how she can become visible , but that does n't mean she 'll be a pretty sight .  < nl > she paused and let out a slow sigh ,  she do n't even remember what she look like to be honest . But in our embrace she should be able to synchronize her wavelength with her plane .  < nl >  Are she human ?  she asked she simply . < nl > she seemed caught off guard but answered ,  she am . Different , but very much human .  < nl > she set her hands on the table and let her mind 's eye look at her soul . < nl >  Then none of this matters . she , love is blind .  < eos > 
< sos > EDIT : Might be NSFW < nl > There Alice is , as always . It 's rude to point , but you 've asked me to show you . There she is . she . I can tell you the story , if you like . I suppose I should . she was n't always like this you know . she used to smile often , even in her madness . Used to talk too . I bet she does n't even know we 're here . I ca n't say which is better , now or before . They claim she 's fixed , finally . But that do n't look fixed to me . Look at she . Perhaps I should tell you the story . < nl > We all knew she from small . she was she and she lived alone on Watts Street . You know the one , near the end of the junction . Back in the eighties she would have been in her thirties then , but she looked older , and to us kids she was an old lady . We were mean I guess , and we used to trouble she some . You know how kids are . < nl > We would knock on her door , like a ding dong ditch kind of thing , but we 'd just stand there a few steps back and be quiet . In those days they did n't have much for the blind , no seeing eye dogs or helpers . she lived alone with her cane . < nl > she 'd cuss us after awhile and then we 'd laugh and run away . she had a temper and maybe that was the crazy rearing its head even all the way back then . her outbursts encouraged us . Soon , we 'd moved on to jumping her fence and making noises all round her house to scare she . < nl > And we scared she alright . she hardly left her house and she always threatened to call the police . We would hear she screaming inside like a ghost . I 'm not proud to say it , but we got a real kick in those days from tormenting she . Maybe we added to her crazy . Who knows ? I hope to God we did n't , but who 's to say ? < nl > One day she broke . It did n't come all at once , but that was definitely the start of it all . she was outside in the park and we were playing tag , I remember . I remember it because we all stopped running then and just stared when we saw it . < nl > she was n't one to leave her house and she was n't one to sit in the park . But there she was and she was talking to someone . she was laughing . That was the first time I ever heard she laugh . And I would n't lie to you ; I found it attractive . < nl > she was laughing alone , but she acted like she was n't alone . her legs were crossed and one arm was over her breasts and another hung there on the back of the bench , like she was hugging someone . < nl > she was acting all flirty then , I remember because she was blushing hard . Us boys had never really interacted with the girls in school too much and she was the first time a lot of us saw what it 's like to act so adult . < nl > And so we stared and listened and called over those who were far away and then there was a crowd just watching she and her imaginary friend . At first she was so engrossed in her talk that she could n't hear us . It was so convincing that I swore I could hear something too , something that was n't she . We all heard it in fact . But there was no one there . < nl > The brain has a way of playing tricks on you , I imagine . We stared for about under a minute when we heard a voice . < nl >  she we should go .  < nl > On my deathbed I will still swear that I heard that voice . It was a rough man 's voice , but of course , there was no one there . < nl > Then she screamed . < nl >  Go away ! Go away !  < nl > And some of the crowd scattered . They had to have heard the voice too . But some of us stayed . she got up and the wind pulled at she and her dress pulled against her body as she made for us . < nl >  Leave she alone !  < nl > And she was mad , you know ? Even if you believe my theory that I 'll soon get to , she was still a little off regardless . You can still see it in her face over there . See how it twitches sometimes ? < nl > But anyway . When she started screaming we all scattered . Not from the regular screams of ' Get away ! ' , but when she started screeching . she fell to her knees and her hands were above her head , like if someone was holding she , trying to get she up . And she was bawling and screeching . < nl > Some adults had heard the noise then and we were running and I did n't see anything that happened . But I knew that the news had spread . Soon she was the talk of the town . Our parents all warned us to stay away from she . Some even asked if we ever saw any strangers around , any men mostly . I knew that they had heard the voice too , some of them . But as time passed you could n't get them to admit as much . If you ask anyone now who lived there then if they remember Carol and the voice , you 'll get a bunch of blank stares . But I swear it was there back then . They asked about it . And we all knew we had heard it . < nl > she was still out those days after . We did n't harass she as much , but some of the meaner ones , not me thankfully , would mock she when they saw she out of her house . But it was always only when she was out . < nl > When she was out she 'd talk to she . The old rumor was that her favorite thing to say was : < nl >  Why are you so quiet now ? Fuck those people . Fuck what they say ?  < nl > she 'd say that as if she was there . But none of us ever saw she . What we did see was the crazy take she and the happiness as well . she would be smiling and laughing those days . she was never like that . It was like a completely different person . < nl >  Manic depression ,  ProtagonistD said to Elva . < nl > The adults always gossiped when they thought we were in bed . And of course we never really stayed asleep . < nl >  It 's all the drugs she probably used . It makes you crazy , like two people inside you .  < nl >  she used * drugs * ?  she said . < nl > I remember how she said it . Like she found out ProtagonistD was fucking ProtagonistD's secretary or something , pardon the language . And at the time ProtagonistD was , but that 's another story . < nl >  Of course she is . she was an addict . It 's no wonder she 's blind . ProtagonistE 's just and ProtagonistE punishes the wicked . she has to be on something . That 's why she 's crazy .  < nl >  We ca n't just leave it at that . What if she does something to the kids ?  < nl > And you the eighties were like the fifties in some places . And the fifties were like the dark ages in some places . Where we lived was like the fifties , and that fifties was dark , really dark and ignorant . < nl > The breaking point for adult action happened because of us . We did n't see much of she anymore and the whole mystery man thing had cooled down . No one saw she so it was easy for your brain to forget a voice . Your brain is good at those things . < nl > So anyway , we did n't see much of she and so we decided to go to her house . Play a prank . < nl > When we got there it was a group of us and we jumped the fence and we were quiet and we made our way to spread out around the house . We were going to all make noise and scare she . See if we could get she running . < nl > But when we were near the walls we heard it . < nl > Over the years I 've asked those who I 'm still in touch with what they had heard then . Almost always they just mention she . < nl >  she was masturbating ,  ProtagonistF said . < nl > ProtagonistF was older than me and should have remembered it clearer . < nl > Arnold said it was just she screaming . < nl > The others did n't want to talk about it . < nl > But what I heard , and what I believe we all heard , was she and she having sex . They were screaming . They were grunting . < nl > I do n't remember the words exactly but I remember how we felt . My face was red and I was aroused and I wanted to see and I was afraid and wanted to run . One of us screamed then when the fear of she came rushing back and then we were running and the noises stopped . < nl > I do n't know what happened then , but I felt her presence and she was behind us but we were faster and I felt another presence too but I never turned around . < nl > Soon we had all scattered and the parents were told . Someone always snitches . < nl > What happened next is like a montage of hearsay . That summer we were kept in doors . The local news was about , searching for she . she was secluded in her house until one day the police came to take she in for questioning . < nl > ProtagonistG , said ProtagonistG saw she kissing she . Where we lived that was bad enough , but ProtagonistG said then that when they saw ProtagonistG staring , they threatened to cut ProtagonistG's throat unless ProtagonistG stayed quiet . < nl > No one cared that the story was bullshit . No one questioned that ProtagonistG said that she was the one who saw ProtagonistG and shouted . All that mattered was that the hysteria was boiling , and the lid had overflowed . < nl > The police came and there were gunshots . The official report was that they heard movement and thought there was another in the house . They fired and did not hit she , but she screamed as if they did . < nl > she was crying and kicking and saying they killed ProtagonistG , whoever ProtagonistG was . < nl > Then she was committed and the national news was starting to swoop in . The story began leaking and I think the pressure was on our mayor to make everything right . < nl > she was diagnosed with a convenient tumor . The operated on she and it was successful , though she seems lobotomized now . she was released soon after and then childhood clouded our memories and ignorance spared the adults . Everything was forgotten and then everything was back to normal . < nl > And so it 's been those decades past . she 's been the same on that bench . It 's the same bench we caught she talking to she on that day so long ago . < nl > she just sits there now , in silence , wasting away . < nl > And that 's my story ... But you do n't look satisfied . What more can I say ? What 's that ? Oh ... my theory . < eos > 
< sos >  Oh , and that 's a bad miss .  < nl >  Indeed it is , Alice . Half the milk 's on the table now . I 'd pass it off as simple drunk clumsiness , if she was n't as sober as a Mormon .  < nl > You sat dumbfounded on your couch , listening to your daily routine being narrated in dulcet tones . You had already restarted the podcast several times , and now were idly wondering if you had gone off the deep end . < nl >  And now , an interview with Carol .  < nl > There was a short trumpet melody . You debated turning the podcast off entirely . After all , you 'd experienced this one before . < nl >  Thank she for being with us today , she . she work two cubicles down from our  cereal - killer  , if I 'm not mistaken ?  < nl > A polite giggle , very feminine and * very * familiar . You began to sweat slightly . < nl >  That 's right , Elva . If it makes any difference , she 's not very good at getting water from the dispenser , either .  Your mind worked desperately as the narrators chuckled , racing through past memories . she had n't been watching your daily water struggle , had she ? < nl >  ... I had told the boys in the editing room , too . I told them , ' she can flirt with the best of them , just as long as she does n't see she try to do anything else . '  < nl >  You did n't !  she shrieked delightedly . You groaned , your future hopes for an office romance being shattered   with every word . < nl >  she 's handsome enough , she suppose , but she get the feeling that it 's only skin deep , you know ?  she continued , speaking in that special tone achievable only by gossipers on talk shows . < nl >  And only above the belt ,  one of the narrators added archly . This was greeted by more laughter . < nl > This was unbearable . Not only was your self - esteem being ravaged , it was being done Daily Show style . < nl >  ... Well , we definitely enjoyed having she in here today , she . I 'm sure she agrees when I say : we should have had she on here sooner .  < nl >  Thank you all , she had a wonderful time !  she sounded genuinely happy , something you had never heard during your conversations with she . < nl >  That was our Morning - Shift Office Talk , with she . Now for Lunch , followed by a special interview with Gyro Cart owner Micheal Anastas .  < nl >  Ah , here she goes now , she . Been listening to a podcast all morning instead of doing work , now she 's clocking out early for lunch .  < nl >  It 's amazing she still has this job , she .  < nl > You listen for over an hour , occasionally pacing back and forth , as every aspect of your day is picked apart and utterly defiled by this mysterious set of narrators . As the podcast draws to a close , however , one last exchange sends you over the edge . < nl >  Heartfelt thanks to everyone who 's made this cast possible , and to all of our listeners who keep us in production . This was  You  , by she and she .  < nl >  Speaking of production , we 're just about to start recording for the next episode . Stay tuned for tomorrow , folks .  < nl > More soothing trumpet music played in the background as you began tearing your living room apart in search of bugs . < eos > 
< sos > Honestly we were both really tired of it . < nl > Our 15 year Pregnancy Anniversary had come and gone with a further - dwindling crowd . When we hit 5 Years , I swear half of the states population came and half of America turned into our broadcast . It was overwhelming , but I suppose I ca n't blame them . The longest on - record was 4 years 8 months , and that kid was the doctor who created the tests to determine the superpowers of each fetus . Incredible stuff , I must say . In fact , many other 3 and 4 year fetuses went on to become these amazing researchers and doctors at his Lab . < nl > That man was born 50 years ago , and no one had ever exceeded 4 years and 3 months . < nl > I could tell that after all that time , the public lost interest . Not that we cared . Doctors grew tired of pestering over Alice and trusted us to be able to take care of she with some home treatments . Hell , they even stopped charging us for Pregnancy - related care after the 6th year . < nl > Carol had especially suffered for it . Our bodies have evolved for 10 , 12 month pregnancies , but 15 years has taken their toll . she was in a constant state of pain in her back and neck , she is restless and seemed to kick daily , sometimes causing she to vomit . < nl > When the birth came , it was jarring . I asked if she was joking , but when she could n't respond , I knew it was happening . We had to make a quiet escape or else the news stations would mob the area . The Ambulance came silently , thank god it was the middle of the night . We sped to the hospital and after 13 more hours of Labor , we had she . The doctors ran the test and found ... nothing . No DNA hints on what it could be . But it was something huge . Well , so huge that the entire DNA strand was different . < nl > We watched she grow and as we did , we noticed she was * incredibly lucky . * If her 1st grade was announcing rewards for the # 1 Student , she 'd win every time . If we said something like  oh , I do n't think we 'll go to the zoo tomorrow . It 's going to storm .  Hell , it could be the middle of a goddamn monsoon and the rain would clear up in * minutes . *  If we said there 's no way she could start a fire with her bare hands , she would conjure a flame at her fingertips . < nl > You may be thinking ,  wait , that last one does n't make sense .  You 're right . Cause after 7 years of countless events similar to the former , she finally told us her power . her baby blue eyes stared big at us as she said  she can manipulate probability .  < nl > We were obviously confused . But she explained .  she can see it in her head . It 's like a dial . On one end it 's 0 , and the other it 's 100 . So like , there 's a 72 % chance that it will rain tomorrow . she can leave it there , she can make it so it wo n't rain no matter what , or she can make it where it will rain all day . What 's the possibility of she growing bird wings and flying ? 0 % ? Why not make that 100 ! !  < nl > And sure enough she awoke with a glorious set of wings . she 's since removed them though . < nl > her powers are truly limitless , and I think that 's why it took 15 years to cook she up . Or so it seemed . < nl > she 's 14 now . Last night she came down crying and ran into my arms . I asked she what was wrong , combing my fingers through her bright red hair .  It- It says she is 100 % possibly going to die tomorrow ,  she sniffed  an - and she ca n't move the dial .  < eos > 
< sos > You know that feeling of being absolutely , and without a shadow of a doubt , wrong ? It 's soul crushing for some , but uplifting for others . All Alice's life she had laughed at the silliness of the religious people because , let 's be honest here , what they were suggesting was often * silly * . < nl > she mean , Earth being a few millennia old ? When you die you get seventy - something virgins ( where did all those virgins come from ) ? Was our world a giant tree , or flat , or shaped like a cigar ? Why was the Pearly Gates not made in another material ? Why did Moses spend forty years in that desert ? Why did you need six arms if you were a goddess ? See what she 'm saying ? < nl > Anyway , she was wrong , and here she was about to be judged for her crimes and spend the rest of her life in ... well , she was curious how they 'd decide which Hell she 'd go to . < nl >  she lived in New York City , that means she belongs to Carol ,  she said and hovered in front of she , her white beard flapping in some unseen breeze . < nl > she stared at the naked body of she . The Christian Hell was one of the worst . she found she inching backward . she had committed most of the sins and would definitely have a rough time down there . < nl >  Need I remind she that she is on an ancient burial ground of my people - that means she 's mine ,  Gitche Manitou whispered softly . < nl > The gaseous form of the Native American deity swirled around her legs . Maybe that would n't be so bad - was there even a Hell in that religion ? she was just about to accept when Elva stepped forth , her one eye ogling her opponents . < nl >  Look at her - those blonde locks and blue eyes ,  Odin rumbled ,  she 's clearly the descendant of a Viking !  < nl > she took a step forward and put her massive hand on her shoulder . she felt she quivering . Then she smiled and winked at she . < nl >  she want she at her table in Valhalla ,  she said .  Choose she , and she 'll let she sit with Freya and the Valkyries .  < nl > Choose ? Did she have a choice in the matter ? Gaping , she stared at the crowd of gods before she . Were they all here to compete for her immortal soul ? < nl >  Of course ,  said a man in a toga , with a lightning bolt crackling in his hand .  Have she ever been to Greece , she ? Join me at Mt. Olympus , and I 'll see to all her needs .  < nl >  And , in return , she 'll have to fill all her needs , I bet ?  said a man with blue skin and four arms .  I 'm sure she 'd * love * to go home with a repeated sex offender or an old nudist fart !  < nl > Both she and Zeus scowled at ProtagonistD as ProtagonistD floated over to she and patted she with ProtagonistD's bottom right hand .  Come with ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistD 'll show ProtagonistD's world . ProtagonistD's religion is one of the oldest , and you know why ? Because it works ! ProtagonistD leave no soul disappointed .  < nl >  What ProtagonistD 's not telling you , is that ProtagonistD's heaven is basically empty ... ProtagonistD 'll send you right back to Earth in the form of a snail or insect - ProtagonistD 'll recycle you until you no longer understand what 's up or down - that 's why ProtagonistD has no complaints because only a select few actually reach the final stage !  < nl > It was ProtagonistE that spoke . Graciously ProtagonistE sauntered up to she , spinning an ankh on ProtagonistE's index finger . < nl >  ProtagonistD's pyramids still stand ,  ProtagonistD continued .  And will continue to do so , long after the churches , temples , and mosques of these fools are gone . ProtagonistD do n't settle for anything less than greatness ... Come with ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistD 'll share ProtagonistD's eternal wisdom ... ProtagonistD 'll show she the true light of the sun !  < nl > That did sound nice ; she had to admit . she had always been fascinated with science in life . Perhaps with access to ProtagonistD's wisdom , she could answer many of the questions she had ? < nl >  Wisdom , hah !  said ProtagonistF , ProtagonistF's golden skin glittering as ProtagonistF laughed .  What wisdom can someone with a giant fidget spinner really provide ?  < nl > ProtagonistF remained cross - legged on ProtagonistF's meditation mat but looked at she intensely .  ProtagonistF 've meditated for thousands of years , and ProtagonistF's insights are unparalleled . If it 's wisdom she 're after , please join ProtagonistF at ProtagonistF's temple - a temple that , for the record , is n't made out of dusty Saharan sand , but from the lively walls of her mind .  < nl > she sighed as ProtagonistG approached she , and a long line of deities snaked behind ProtagonistG , all waiting for their turn to try and convince she . The choice seemed like an impossible one to make . < nl >  Guys , she need to think ,  she said and sat down under a tree . < nl > she looked at all the odd figures watching she expectantly . she 'd never thought dying would be so stressful . What if she picked the wrong one ? < nl > ProtagonistH was leaning against the tree . she did n't remember ProtagonistH approaching she . < nl >  Why did n't ProtagonistH offer she anything to choose ProtagonistH's heaven ?  she asked . < nl >  Who ? Me ?  ProtagonistH said and took a sip from a jar .  ProtagonistH do n't really care ; ProtagonistH 'm just filling in for Jupiter .  < nl >  she desperately need a drink right now .  < nl > ProtagonistH shrugged and handed she the jar . she had expected to taste the nectar of heaven , but instead , cheap box - wine rolled down her throat . < nl >  So , what do ProtagonistH have to offer she ?  she asked after another gulp . < nl >  Nothing , really ,  ProtagonistH said .  ProtagonistH usually just chill out , you know ... drink wine , eat grapes ... nothing interesting .  < nl > she smiled . After living a stressful life , all she wanted to do was relax . < nl >  she think she 'll choose ProtagonistH's heaven ,  she said after a drawn out pause . < nl > ProtagonistH shrugged .  she 'll have to get her own jar , though .  < nl > * * * * * < nl > For more stories check out r / Lilwa_Dexel < nl > Thank ProtagonistH for the gold ! < eos > 
< sos > The judge slammed his gavel on the wooden block and silence fell like a blanket over the court . < nl > Alice sat perfectly still in her seat , her face - usually stretched wide by a warm smile - was now blank . Expressionless . < nl >  The jury find she guilty on all charges .  < nl > her head fell into her hands and her body shook as she wept . Carol placed an arm around her shoulders . I heard she murmur soft reassurances , but I was too far back to make out the exact words of the impotent promises . < nl >  I am sad ,  continued the judge ,  to find that her gift was not spent stopping crime , but instead from preventing it * being * stopped - and from preventing the city itself from tackling its problems at the roots . All her acts were done solely to further her career and profile . she are an egotist , in the worst and most dangerous fashion .   In her * all - for - show * heroics , she , many innocent people died . Collateral damage to she , perhaps - but loved ones to others . Bricks falling on heads , and trains coming to sudden , horrific halts . * Heart attacks * from her ludicrous speeds when flying with people in her arms - and who could forget Mr Kennedy ? It is with deep regret - * regret at the potential she wasted * - that I sentence she to the most severe punishment this court , or any other , can . To death .  < nl > A wave of shock ran through the people in the court ; gasps and cries and shocked nothings . Elva was in tears ; ProtagonistD picked she up and rubbed she back .  There , there . It 'll be okay , she ,  ProtagonistD cooed . < nl > But it would n't be ' okay ' . < nl > she would n't protest the decision . < nl > she would n't even fight for her life . < nl > Pathetic . < nl > I knew she 'd give in , because she respected the law . Believed in justice - her world was built on unshakeable foundations . she 'd allow she to die for childish dreams and impossible ideals . she 'd allow the city to twist the knife deep into her back . < nl > It had been so easy to pay off the criminals of the city for a few short weeks . Their sprees could continue soon , and there would be no Dazzler to stop them . The hope of the city , when they realised what they had done to she , would be snuffed out like a candle - the rising smoke lingering forever in the skies above them . < nl > A smog that would slowly suffocate them . < nl > I excused myself from the courtroom , holding the grin from my face until I was safely behind the wooden doors . < nl > --- < nl > I asked ProtagonistE if ProtagonistE 'd like to write a part 2 , and ProtagonistE very kindly agreed - so please check out ProtagonistE's reply below :) < nl > More of my stories on /r / nickofnight < eos > 
< sos > Alice lay shivering in bed , her hands clutching the sweat - soaked duvet tightly around she , the bed heater back on .   It had been lke this for the past three days , and she wished she was already dead .   The boiling heat alternated with freezing cold for hours at a time , and every muscle of her body seemed to protest as she slowly forced she to sit up , to push the duvet away long enough to pull the laptop closer to she . < nl > she typed her bank account password in with quivering fingers , and cringed .   The money was still gone , and without that , she could n't afford the bus fare to the clinic across town , let alone the drug . < nl > her neck ached with the effort to hold her neck up , and she rested it gently against the back of the bed .   she had maybe another 12 hours before she died , and her hopes that Carol was coming back were fading fast .   Damn , but she had been such a fool .   They 'd been dating for 6 months now , and she 'd said she needed her card to buy something online , would she mind . < nl > she 'd hesitated .   Looking back , she winced .   she 'd looked so hurt - do n't she trust she ? - and she 'd foolishly given in . < nl > The next day she 'd text she to cancel their planned dinner , as she had to go on a work trip .   Two days later , her money was gone , and she was safe .   The police could n't help , the loans company would n't , and she was ... well , dead .   Even the charities she 'd reached out to had turned she away , because she had been wealthy enough to afford medicine until only a few days before . < nl > Their work , they had stressed , was for people who were employed in lower wage jobs , and couln't afford both drugs and food .   Those with children .   Could n't she ask her parents for money ? < nl > Of course , she could , theoretically .   But she would n't .   Maybe she even could n't . < nl > Finally , as a last resort , she had asked Elva for her wages in advance to cover she .   Just until the end of the month , she 'd stressed .   she 'd be able to save and skrimp enough to cover the cost of the drug on that , surely . < nl > she 'd told she to go home and look after she , that she 'd see what she could do ... but given that her bank account was still sat at a resolute , red zero .   Well . < nl > Perhaps it was for the best .   she forced she out of bed and across to the kitchen sink .   It was the first time since she 'd moved in that she was glad all she could afford was a bedsit .   Not bothering to grab a glass , she leaned slowly forward until her tongue could touch the stream of water , tilted her head to one side , and gulped thirstly .   Then , groaning , she shuffled back to bed , threw her duvet onto the floor , and spread out , her skin on fire . < nl > she slept . < nl > she was forced awake by a dry , prickly mouth , and sat up slowly .   The fever seemed to have worked its way out of her system , and although still a little sore , she could stand without an internal dialogue .   she grinned . < nl > But , wait . < nl > she should be dead .    Is this ... heaven ?    she asked aloud , looking around her deserted room .   Maybe someone had come in , given she something - but the door was still deadbolted , the window latched . < nl > her hands still shook as she poured a glass of water .   Maybe , she thought , this was the second wind , the nice bit before death .   But she felt fine .   Better than fine .   she almost wanted to dance with how fine she felt . < nl >  she 'm alive .    she told the wall , confidently .   Then she turned to the stuffed cat an old friend had bought she , and told it too .    she 'm alive !  < nl > she span around in a circle , which was somewhat ill - advised as she immediately felt dizzy .   she had n't eaten anything more nutrious than the few slices of dry toast she had nibbled in her bed on the few occasions she had made it to the kitchen , before it had gone blue . < nl >  Ok ,  she said ,  she need to eat .  < nl > she had a yoghurt in the fridge , which she consumed while rooting through her freezer drawer for a ready meal .   Nothing .   Dammit .   And she still had no money for shopping . < nl > Three bendy carrots , a slightly mushy bag of spinach , and three sausages would have to do then , and she quickly set to work . < nl > How was she not dead ? < nl > ProtagonistD !   she had to call ProtagonistD ! < nl > she whirled around , the spitting sausages forgotten momentarily , and scrambled among her bedding for her phone .   Which was dead . < nl > she swore , then plugged it in next to the hob , balancing it on the top of the microwave .   Finally , the battery symbol came on , and she mashed the power button with her thumb , the other hand futily jostling the sausages . < nl >  she ?    A dubious voice picked up .    Why are she calling ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD , listen .   she know it 's been a while .   she know she said some stupid , horrible things .   But ProtagonistD need to know something .  < nl >  Ok .  < nl >  Take a seat .   Somewhere quiet , somewhere alone .   Please , this is important .  < nl >  Give ProtagonistD a minute .  < nl > she grabbed at the sausages with one hand and dumped them onto a plate , too hungry to care if they were done .   Then , sucking her burnt fingers , she tapped the speakerphone button and pulled her chair closer to the phone . < nl >  What is it , ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD were right .  < nl >  What ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD were right .   she ... look , it 's a long story , but she did n't have money for tablets this month .  < nl >  Are she alright ?  < nl >  Yes , yes , that 's the point .   she did n't take them , but she 'm also still alive .  < nl > There was a staticy silence on the phone for a few heartbeats .    Are she sure ?  < nl >  What do ProtagonistD mean , am she sure ?    she took a bite of sausage , and spoke around it .    Of course she 'm sure .  < nl >  We ca n't talk on the phone .   They might be listening .  < nl > she bit down the urge to tell ProtagonistD she was being paranoid - after all , that had been part of their fight in the first place - and , she realised , if ProtagonistD had been right about this ... < nl >  Just answer a few questions , OK ?    she hummed her agreement .    OK .   When was her last dose ?      4 days ago .     What were her symptoms ?     Mostly fever .     Where are she now ?     Town centre , Burkley Street .     ProtagonistD 'm on ProtagonistD's way .   Stay there , do n't open the door to anyone .   Do she understand ?     Yes .  < nl > ProtagonistD hung up .   she continued eating her sausages . < nl > 5 minutes later there was a knock at the door .   It was only instinct that kept she from calling out .   Instead , she slowly slid along the floor , her heart thundering in her chest .   Another knock , loud and authoritative .    she .   I know she 're in there .   Please answer the door .  < nl > she held her breath .    she , please .   We do n't want to hurt she .  < nl > Trying desperately to be as quiet as possible , she breathed in , and then out .   How did they know she was there . < nl > A new voice , female , spoke .    We 're working with ProtagonistD .   ProtagonistD asked us to pick she up , as our team was closer .  < nl > Now she knew that these people were n't going to help she .   ProtagonistD would have told she if she was delegating the task .   But while they were here , would ProtagonistD be able to come help she . < nl > There were another few minutes of tense silence , and then she heard footsteps heading from her door down the corridor .   Were they trying to trick she ?   Convinced she 'd died ? < nl > A thud , on the wall .   she squealed in shock , and clasped a hand over her mouth .   Another thud .   My god , were they breaking down the wall ? < nl > Without thinking about it , she grabbed a knife from the washing up pile and clenched it in a white fist .   she would not die , not after surviving that fever .   she would fight . < nl > There was a silence , stretched across several seconds , and then somehow the bolt on the door began to draw back .   she lunged across the room , and pushed it shut again , fighting against some other force . < nl >  Hey .    A whisper came .    It 's ok , just me .   Open up .  < nl > Somehow , she could n't trust the voice , even if it sounded a little like ProtagonistE .    Seriously , she , open up .   ProtagonistD have approximately 5 minutes to get she out of here before they wake up .  < nl > Tentatively , she pressed her lips up against the crack of the door .    What did ProtagonistD give she , the night before we went to prom ?  < nl >  A stuffed lion .   she , come on , we need to go .  < nl > Scared , still clutching the knife , she baked away from the bolt .   It moved again .   Then there was ProtagonistD's grinning face , pushing it open , grabbing she and pulling she through .   Two crumpled SWAT officers were by the door , heads resting against one another . < nl > ProtagonistD was dressed in black , riot police like clothes , a small handgun clenched in one hand .   Silently , ProtagonistD pulled she down the hall , into a stairwell , and down they went .    she she , ProtagonistD 'm so glad she called .  < nl > Lucy , concious of her knife - and her dirty pyjamas - said nothing .   she did n't know what to do , whether to trust ProtagonistD .   she had no other choice . < nl >  she 're a medical marvel , she .   ProtagonistD have some doctors ProtagonistD want she to meet .    ProtagonistD paused by the door to the basement , looked she up and down , and pulled she into a quick hug .    Come on , we 've got work to do .  < eos > 
< sos > The creature was small and delicate , with spindly limbs covered in thin white hairs . Alice was frozen in place . < nl > One of its fingers curled , and its round head bobbed insistently . It was beckoning to she ; as her heart fluttered nervously , she leaned forward until they were nose to nose . It grasped at the fabric of her space suit and pulled she closer , bringing its mouth to her ear . < nl > And then its hand whipped out , a finger jabbed she in the chest , and it said ,  she 're it .  The creature giggled like a child , scurrying away with its head wobbling back and forth . < nl > Standing there with her mouth parted , she watched her chance at world - renowned achievement skip through an alien wilderness . she came to a sudden , irrational decision : she had to chase after it . < nl > The oxygen levels were just high enough to support a little bit of running , so she tossed aside her space helmet and dove into the forest of red vines . As she plunged deeper and deeper into the planet , dust swirled around each step and left dented footprints in the sandy dirt . she was following its path of bird - like tracks , stopping every so often to catch her breath or get her bearings . < nl > When she finally found the creature , it was curled into a ball , staring out at she with wide eyes . she grabbed it roughly by the elbow , and it shrieked in delight . < nl >  Say it ,  it told she .  Say it , say it !  < nl > she raised an eyebrow at it , cheeks flushed from exertion .  We 're not playing games , you extraterrestrial bobble head .  < nl > It gave she a look of innocent confusion .  I 'm it ?  < nl > she dragged the little alien back through the forest , and hacked at vines the whole way ; the creature was oddly quiet . When they reached the shuttle , it began to scrabble at the ground . Its fingers and toes clutched at the dust , leaving claw marks in the sand . < nl > The color drained from its face .  No thank she ,  it said shrilly .  No ! No thank she !  It squirmed and kicked against she , hissing and biting , before suddenly going silent again . < nl >  Crap ,  said she , feeling for a heartbeat . They were , after all , fragile - looking creatures , and she was afraid she 'd strangled it on accident . < nl > A finger darted up and poked she in the nose .  she 're it !  And off it scampered , over the shuttle and into the tunnels behind it . she raced after it . < nl > her radio buzzed , and a grainy voice came through :  Where are she , dammit ? Over .  < nl >  Busy ,  she answered through gritted teeth .  Over .  < nl >  For Christ 's sake , she , we thought something took she . Why the hell did n't she answer ? Over .  < nl > she stumbled on a purple root , falling soundly into the hard rock of the tunnel . < nl >  she ?  < nl >  she found something .  There was a slickness to the rock that made climbing difficult -- her knuckles were white as they gripped the cracks and crevices . < nl >  We need she back at the lab . Over .  < nl > A chittering noise came from her right , and her head moved to follow the sound . Then she heard the tell - tale giggle .  Quiet ,  she whispered into the radio . < nl >  Sarah--  < nl > The quiet laughter stopped .  Crap !  < nl >  Are she okay ?  < nl >  she lost it again .  she sighed .  Look , she 've got to catch this thing . she 'll be back later . Over and out .  she switched the radio off . < nl > And then she followed the alien through the tunnels . It is likely that she and the alien have played that game a long , long time , because not a soul heard from she ever again . < eos > 
< sos > Alice was so used to the creatures crowding her vision , she rarely gave them a second glance anymore . < nl > Giant hulking rabbit with four eyes and wings , dragons that wheeled over the cities , massive , slick sea creatures that gamboled and played in the rivers and oceans . she was n't able to touch them , and they never seemed to see she - but they were always something that was uniquely she . she wrote stories about them , but never showed her writing to anyone . That would make the creatures real to others , and they were * she * . Until she saw Carol . < nl > she had somehow found the perfect , shifting molten shade of gold to capture the glint of Elva's folded wings . she ventured closer , certain that she would n't look up at her approach . she must be one of the ghosts of this shadow world that were n't actually real . < nl > It was probably just her imagination weaving absurdly vivid pictures , or some delusion . she really should see a professional soon , but it was so lovely to have this ability . What if she were prescribed antipsychotics , and the world became drab and colourless , none of her creatures to fill the skies and the oceans ? What if her imagination disappeared too , and she could n't write anymore at all ? she did n't want to let it go . Why , she seemed magical , with her swirling cloak , and waves of ink black hair like a raven 's wing ... < nl >  Do people in her realm never greet properly ?  she suddenly spoke softly , pausing where she had been painting her massive front claw . < nl > her mouth dropped open , and she smiled widely at her disbelief . < nl >  Oh , great ,  she muttered .  Auditory hallucinations , too , what fun .  < nl > To prove it , the other people in the park were giving her nervous looks , as if afraid she would attack them at any moment . she gave a rich chuckle and turned back to her picture , mixing gold and white to get the colour of her belly just right . < nl >  Oh , she 're no more ' crazy ' than any of the people in her world ,  she told she .  Just gifted enough to catch the odd glimpses of the other realms . Where do she think her greatest artists and writers found their inspiration ? You know , she like she . Do she know the name of her friend over there ?  < nl > she dismissed the strangeness of the conversation to focus on the question . It seemed vastly important , suddenly , and she found the name as she looked upon she . < nl >  Ryna ,  she said , and she nodded slowly . On the grass , she rolled in her sleep and gave a soft rumble . < nl >  Good guess . It 's close enough - it seems she 're more in tune with our realm than she thought ,  she said .  Look , she almost heard she . Names are important , she , remember that . It 's the call between realms . What is she ?  < nl >  Sophie ,  she said , without thinking , and her black eyes gleamed brightly .  What 's she ?  < nl >  she ,  she echoed her name softly , ignoring her question , and touched her hand . < nl > she felt it , a warm and fleeting brush of skin .  Well , she . she can allow she to become a greater part of our world , if she wish . she can be her ... guide , as it were . her realm will unlock her potential in ... what do she like to do ? Are she a painter , like she , or perhaps she sing ?  < nl >  Well , she do like to write , sometimes ,  she whispered , almost afraid to say it out loud .  But she 'm not any good .  < nl >  Ah , a * writer * . she do love writers . After she visit , she will write like never before ,  she winked at she .  she know , she 've seen it happen . she 've taken some from her realm before . ProtagonistD was one of our most famous visitors , and a dear friend to she . ProtagonistD ... it 's funny , ProtagonistD was always able to see she , you know . Never got her name quite right , though , no matter how many times she told ProtagonistD .  < nl > she lapsed into a thoughtful silence . < nl >  But there is danger , too , she wo n't lie , and perhaps she will curse she for drawing she in ,  she continued slowly .  But perhaps she 'll enjoy it , it 's always so difficult to know how one of she will react . Perhaps she are strong enough . Call on she if she wish for it . But remember - with every visit , she will become more removed from her own plane . It could become difficult to fully return . Some have lost themselves along the way .  < nl >  This is n't real , is it ?  she asked , as she turned her back on she and finished the painting . < nl >  she see she need convincing ,  she chuckled , and took the painting from the easel . The fresh paint gleamed and the colours seemed to shift , unnaturally bright in the afternoon sun . she handed it to she with a strange little grin . < nl >  Here , a little memento from she , it will prove how real she am . And she 'll give she another gift : the name 's Nevamor . Call on she if she wish , she , and she will visit again . Think it over well .  < nl > she walked home in a daze , staring at the picture of the sleeping dragon sprawled on the grass . It was an almost perfect rendition of she . Ryna . < nl > her roommate , Elizabeth , frowned when she let she into the apartment . As always , she looked like she was tripping on five kinds of drugs . < nl >  Hey . she ok ?  ProtagonistE asked she . < nl >  she 'm fine ,  she sighed , putting the picture on the coffee table . < nl > she would make an appointment to see a psychiatrist this week , she promised she . Hallucinating the feel and touch of her hand and a whole painting was becoming less harmless and more frightening . It would be best if she just tried to forget about all of it , and never called her name . That would just indulge her delusions . < nl >  Well , ok . ProtagonistE 'm going out , there 's leftovers in the fridge ,  ProtagonistE said , heading to the door .  Nice painting , by the way . Where 'd she get it ?  < nl > she was staring at ProtagonistE , eyes stretched wide in shock . ProtagonistE shrugged and headed out , shaking ProtagonistE's head a bit at her behaviour . < nl > Hours later , when she returned to an empty apartment , she tried not to worry - even though she had promised she 'd be home tonight . her roommate had always been a rather odd one , and liked to wander off on her own . she would be fine , wherever she was . < nl > On the windowsill , a raven she could n't see gave a cawing laugh she never heard . < nl > -------- < nl > [ * * Part Two added here.**](https://www.reddit.com / r / Inkfinger / comments/6ntlb4 / ever_since_you_were_a_kid_you_were_able_to_see/ ) < nl > Hope you enjoyed her story !

< sos > Alice wiped her brow on her sleeve and put another batch of donuts in the oven . During the summer it got so hot inside the little shop that she could soon bake on the counter . This was the opening day of her store and she was already growing dizzy . she looked over and saw that Carol was waiting . < nl >  Just a minute !  she called out and tried to straighten out her wrinkly apron .  Hi , welcome to Mana & Other Sweet Things ! What can she get she ?  < nl > she looked very different from the peasants that had visited her shop earlier . she wore a long black robe , despite the hot weather , and her pale face was partially covered by the shade of a cloak . With a bony hand , she put a white lock of hair behind her ear , revealing three golden hoops in her earlobe . < nl >  she 'm looking for something sweet ,  she said ,  Something to get the necromancy flowing .  < nl >  Well , she 've come to the right place then !  < nl >  How much does it cost ?  she said and fumbled with her gold pouch . < nl >  That depends on what you 'd like .  < nl > her forehead rippled in furrows . she touched her chin and sighed . < nl >  Do she have any donuts ?  she said , and tilted her head forward , looking at she intently . < nl >  Of course ,  she chimed .  They 're her specialty .  < nl >  Can she have a taste before she decide ?  < nl >  she usually do n't do tastings .  < nl >  Then how can she know if it 's good ?  < nl >  she suppose she 're right ,  she said and cut out a piece of donut and handed it over on a paper plate . < nl >  Oh , yes ,  she said , her gray eyes lighting up .  This is it ; this is what she 've been looking for !  < nl >  she 'm glad she liked it ,  she said , smiling . < nl >  No , she do n't understand ,  she said , flapping her arms .  This is it ! This is the one ! she are the one !  < nl >  What ?  she said with a laugh . < nl > she knew her donuts were good , but she had never before seen anyone become so ecstatic . < nl >  she 're the only hope for humanity ,  she said sweat dripping down her forehead .  she 've traveled land and sea to find she .  < nl >  Okay , she ,  she said and helped she to a chair .  It 's probably best if she sit down , the heat must 've gotten to she . Here , have a glass of water .  < nl > she drank deeply .  she 'm telling she ; people will come and when they do she have a choice-  < nl > At that very moment , the doorbell chimed and three other robed figures entered . The tallest one , a man with a beard and round glasses , spoke first . < nl >  We 've traveled far !  < nl >  Oh , how far we 've traveled !  the man with the square - shaped glasses muttered without enthusiasm .  Very , very , veeeeeeeeeeery far .  < nl > she felt a jolt in her chest . she looked she in the eyes . < nl >  Remember what she told she ,  she said and hurried out of the store . < nl > Elva walked up to the counter and spoke for the first time . < nl >  she 've never seen such a well - organized pastry shop before ...  she said .  Utterly top notch , it 's like she 've walked into the royal bakery and the king himself had organized it .  < nl > Another jolt surged through her body .  Yes , she 'm sorry - she opened just this morning - she have n't had time to put prices on everything yet .  < nl >  she 'll have one of those !  she said and pointed at a carrot - cake cupcake .  That is if she can afford it - who knows , that piece of pastry might be more expensive than Archmage Ruttersmore 's cross - eyed cluck - duck . There 's no real way of knowing , is there ?  < nl >  It 's two silver pieces , she ,  she said as her face flushed , and newfound power flowed through she . < nl >  Well , she guess they 're about the same price ...  < nl > If she wanted , she now felt like she had the power to throw these schmucks to the other side of the city . she had never wanted to be a big mage - all she wanted to do was bake - so when her time had come , she had picked the most stupid source of power that she could think of . So that she would be left alone . < nl >  We know who she are , she . The council sent us here to test her powers . Now if she would be so kind to come with us - she 're the first person to choose sarcasm as their source - and we need to bring she in for ...  < nl >  Further experiments ,  his companion filled in . < nl >  Well , it 'd be such a delight to accompany you , she 'll come right away ,  she said and flicked her wrist . < nl > The three wizards landed on their butts on the street outside . < nl >  And she 'd just loooove to be experimented on a bit ,  she continued .    You 're welcome back * anytime * you want !  < nl > her powers at an all - time high , she placed the strongest sanctuary spell ever seen in the twelve kingdoms on her little bakery . The wooden walls glowed with magical energy . Spent , she sat down behind the counter . Nobody that she did n't want inside would able to enter , not even the Archmage 's golden cluck - duck . And to top it off , the sanctuary spell had a built - in AC . < nl > * * * * * < nl > Subscribe to r / Lilwa_Dexel for more stories . < eos > 
< sos >  Sarah ?  asked Alice . her mouth was dry and her heart beat like a gavel in her ears . Every time , the anticipation - * the hope * - swallowed she up and allowed she to imagine Carol was back . Then , it would chew she up and spit she out , and she would feel the same terrible things as when she 'd found her body in the bathroom . < nl > It took she a moment to realise she had returned . she craned her neck up to look for she . she stood at the end of the table , her lips trembling , and her pale face wearing a smile that was at the same time hopeful and utterly desperate . It pained she to see she like this . < nl >  she 'm sorry , James .  < nl >  she ...  she whispered , as she slumped down against a bookshelf .  It 's she again ...  < nl > her arms gained feeling before her legs ; one at a time , she threw her thighs off the table and , using her legs as anchors , sat up .   her face was more lined than before and her hairline had scampered further back . her eyes were gray and hollow . she thought she was the most tortured soul she 'd ever seen . < nl > she turned her head slowly and looked about the basement ; the bookshelves held many new black tomes , thick and weathered . There were both more crosses and pentagrams dotted around the room - more of her wife 's old dresses , too . Then , she saw the mirror and let out a gasp . < nl > she looked up .  Are she okay , she ?  < nl >  Where ... where did she get the body from ?  she gently touched her face , running a finger down the smooth curves of her cheeks . < nl >  Oh . she was in a skiing accident . Broke her neck . she ,  she paused and frowned ,  she did n't think she killed she , did she ?  < nl >  No ! The thought never crossed her mind ,  she lied . < nl >  Good . Because , she know she better than that by now , she think .  < nl >  Of course . It 's just she was taken back ... * she 's so beautiful * .  < nl > she nodded .  she think Sarah would have been happy with it .  < nl > she nodded .  she ,  she began , reaching down and stretching her legs out ,  she ca n't keep doing this .  < nl >  she 'm * so * close , she . she think she even know where she went wrong - next time she 'll get it !  < nl > she sighed .  she , listen to she . she 's not coming back .  < nl >  she 're wrong !  she snapped .  she just need to keep going . she need to keep trying .  < nl > she saw tears welling in her eyes , and felt a warm wetness running down her own cheeks . she could n't stand it any longer . It would hurt she , but she had to do it . she had to put an end to this - for her sake , and for she . < nl >  she , she know how she died .  < nl >  Yes , of course .   she was murdered - and she was n't there to protect she .  < nl >  she found she in the bath .  < nl >  They slit her wrists ,  she said , her face blank and her voice suddenly void of emotion . < nl >  * she * slit her wrists .  < nl >  No . That 's not what happened .  < nl >  she 've spoken to she , she . Many times .  < nl >  * What ? *  she said , her eyes widening and her teeth clenching together .  Why would n't she have told she that before !  < nl >  she did n't want to tell she because , she thought it would hurt she too much .  < nl > she paused for a moment .  When she go back , she need she to find she . Tell she , she 'll find a way to bring she here . Tell she , she love she .  < nl >  she loves she too , she .  < nl >  she know ,  she whispered . < nl >  But she does n't want to come back . she ca n't . she chose to leave the world , not just you . Trying to force she back , because she miss she ... it 's ... it 's just selfish .  < nl >  Go back ,  she said , getting up from the floor .  Go back , before she send she back she .  Both her arms and voice were trembling . < nl >  Please , she .  < nl >  Go back !  she screamed , running to a shelf and snatching a knife .  Or she swear to God ...  < nl > she swallowed . she forced she off the table and began walking toward she . she * had * to get to she , to make she see - but she only managed a single step before her legs gave way and she fell to the cold , concrete floor . her head bounced off the ground and pain shot through her body . < nl > she walked over to she , knife in hand . she turned she over ; blood dribbled out of her forehead , dyeing her blonde hair a sticky strawberry . < nl >  she 'm sorry ,  she said . < nl >  Please ... do n't bring she back anymore ,  she said , as the knife hung over her chest .  Let this be the end .  < nl > There was something new in her voice - or maybe it was in her eyes - that surprised she . It was something * familiar * . < nl >  Sarah ?  she whispered as her face grew pale . < nl > The blade rested above she for a few seconds , swaying back and forth like a pendulum . she thrust her arms up and grabbed hold of her hands ; she forced them down , plunging the knife deep into her chest . < nl > she could feel her life slipping away . Somewhere far in the distance , she could hear she screaming - * begging * . < nl >  Goodbye , baby ,  she said , as the light dwindled to darkness . < nl > --- < nl > /r / nickofnight < eos > 
< sos > Their parents tell them that they 're too young to wander off by themselves . Alice does n't look too young though , she looks really big ever since she woke up . It 's neat , everyone thinks she 's a grown up now and that means she can do lots of things she could n't before without anyone shouting . Mummy and Daddy still shout because they know she 's not really a grown up , but nobody else can tell . < nl > It 's really helpful because it means she can show Carol what a cool older sister she is . she is only little ; she was n't even in Mummy 's tummy when she went to sleep . she really wants she to be her friend so she thinks she 'll take she to do a big girl thing together - something she could n't do if she were still asleep . < nl > They leave the garden quietly and start walking hand in hand . It 's not hard to find the mall , she is really good at reading and there are signs all the way from the main road near the house right up to the mall car park . It takes a long time , hours and hours , and their feet hurt when they arrive . They go inside and look in all the shops and have a really good time even though they ca n't buy anything . Nobody asks them where their parents are all day . Nobody thinks to stop them . Why would they ? < nl > There are n't any signs leading from the mall to the house . < eos > 
< sos > Hi ! I 'm new to Writing Prompts and I 'd appreciate any feedback you 're willing to give ! < nl > -------------------- < nl > Alice pulled her clothes tightly across her shoulders and looked down . All she wanted to do was pay for her groceries . But no ; They had to ask . Everytime . Every . Single . Time . < nl >  she got any clue what it means yet ?  Carol , asked . < nl > she quickly took a swig of water .  Hmm ?  she hummed , desperately digging for her credit card . Of course , she knew what she was asking about . she had told them that she had received a tattoo resembling a water bottle . she had n't , but it was easier than telling people that she did n't have any . A tattoo of a water bottle was also strange enough that people would believe she when she said that she did n't know what it meant . < nl > No one in this town could mind their own business . Everywhere she went , she saw burly men proudly displaying their art - filled biceps and speaking stories of heroism . Some of her friends had  4.0 ,  or images depicting their sleepless nights of studying to pass a class . Others had their current League of Legends ranking proudly displayed . Everyone had something . Except she . < nl > It was n't that she was a bad student , or that she sucked at video games ; it was quite the opposite really . The tattoos were meant to represent a great achievement , and , well , those things did n't cut it for she . < nl >  her tattoo ,  she leaned closer , eager to hear about her achievement ,  what does it mean ? Elva said she got a waterbottle .  < nl > her lips fell into a scowl . she yearned to return to the days before she got over her fear of public speaking and received a microphone tattoo on her throat . she used to be someone she could talk to ; she used to be someone she could trust to tell that she had n't received a tattoo . < nl > Lying to him-- telling she about her  tattoo  -- was probably one of the hardest things she had done . But it was necessary . At least , that 's what she told she . Nowadays , she could n't keep her mouth shut . No one in this godforsaken town could . < nl >  No clue ,  she mumbled ,  still figuring it out .  < nl > she handed she her credit card . In the process , she knocked over her water bottle , and liquid spilled all over the counter . < nl > she cursed and scanned the room for paper towel . she ran over to the dispenser and got a few sheets . < nl >  No , no ,  she began ,  it 's quite alright . We 'll get it .  < nl >  she got it ,  she insisted ,  and , hey , who knows , this could be what her tattoo is for : cleaning up after her mistakes .  she laughed bitterly . < nl > There was more water spillage than she initially thought . And it was n't just over the counter ; she somehow managed to spray water onto her  employee of the month  tattoo across her forearm . < nl > she cursed again .  Sorry . Let me help she with that .  < nl >  Seriously ,  she cleared her throat and backed away . < nl >  No , really , it 's ok ,  she said as she grabbed her wrist and wiped her arm with the towel . As she did so , the white paper towel became streak with green and yellow . < nl > her eyes widened .  What the ... ?  < nl > Edit : a word < nl > Edit 2 : removed  it was fake  to better flow into part 2 . < eos > 
< sos > Alice was in complete shot when she saw Carol . Halfway across the world here she was , and in the shadows of the Eiffle Tower she reached up to take off her sunglasses . That 's when she spotted that precious bare skin , like a gift sent down from heaven for she . < nl >  Pardone moi !  she screamed in her terrible , terrible French and rushed toward she ,  Je suis ... eh ... Tu ...  < nl >  It 's okay , she 'm American ,  she said back with a tone that betrayed nothing if not boredom ,  What is it ?  < nl > American ! It would n't have mattered at all , of course , but knowing that she speaks her language , knows her world , it made the entire situation that much sweeter . To top it off , she was gorgeous , easily more gorgeous than any woman she 'd seen in years . < nl >  her wrist !  she immediately fumbled out , pointing toward her arm ,  she do n't have one either ! she 've never seen anyone else that did n't have it !  < nl >  Ha , good one ,  she shot back as she dismissively waved her arm toward her own wrist . Of course she was far too nervous , she should have told she that she draw she on . < nl >  No , no !  she stuttered out , holding up her wrist ,  This thing ? This thing is--  < nl >  Fake , right ? she draw it on ? Or no , wait , it 's a stamp ? Yeah , yeah . she 've heard 'em all .  < nl >  What ?  she said back , confused . < nl >  Listen she , she 're not the first guy to try this , and she 'm not interested . she 'm not some one - night stand , she , and the fact that she 'm destined to look around for anybody out there who may or may not exist does n't have she too excited to play these stupid little pick - up games .  < nl >  No ! she promise she  she hurriedly yelled out ,  Just look , she 'll wash it off ! Come with she , there 's a cafe around the corner and watch she wash it off !  < nl >  Riiiight , cafe around the corner . she do n't quit , do she ? Well she do ,  she finished and briskly walked off . she tried to chase after , but in moments she flooded into a crowd and disappeared . < eos > 
< sos > Alice was n't the only one who refused her words , of course . But most people eventually said them after a few centuries , driven by boredom or heartache or apathy . Or pain . < nl > You could suffer in pain for eternity , but still you would live , unless you said the words . Others insisted you simply came to long for proper rest , or so she had been told . But she never had . she was approaching 750 , and she had never grown tired of life . she privately believed that was why the Gods had given she the words she had known since birth : a curse to balance her never - ending hunger for life . < nl > Today , she was choking on them . < nl > she considered Carol's face , tight with pain as she laboured for breath . Before long , she would be too far gone to hear and understand what she said . she might become one of the countless withered bodies that never left the state facilities dedicated to such cases . Too delirious to remember her words , she would hang in limbo for eternity . Elva was nearly there already . And she owed she the words , even though she had never demanded them . she owed she everything . < nl > The window was open , and she stepped closer to take a breath of the crisp night air , smiling at the twin moons that winked at she from the sky . It was a lovely planet , newly opened for habitation . They had meant to spent at least a century here , but life happens . Death happens . < nl > Any minute now , a nurse would come for the nightly check - up . They would be done before then . < nl >  she love she ,  she told she . her last and most vibrant of partners , wasted almost beyond recognition now . The bones of her once full cheeks were jutting out . she smiled to see her eyes flutter open , to catch one more glimpse of those luminous blue eyes . The rest of she had faded , but never those eyes . < nl > she grasped her hands , a surprisingly strong grip . she laboured for breath she now , as she groped for her words . her heart leapt as she saw she smile , that same teasing smile she had given she so many times during the past two centuries . Whenever she hugged she and kissed her neck , or presented she with flowers after she had done some small thing for she . Whenever she wanted to say her own words , but could n't . < nl >  Thank she ,  she breathed , and silence reigned as a chill wind swept through the room . she was coming , but she was n't worried . < nl > she was n't alone . < nl > --------- < nl > Hope you enjoyed my story ! You can find more of my work on /r / Inkfinger/. < eos > 
< sos >  Who are Alice ?  Carol yelled at she . she raised a hand to her eyes and squinted , trying to get a better look at she - trying to decide if she should grab Elva's hand and run far away from here , never turning , never looking back . But she knew they could n't run . They 'd * probably * die if they stayed , but she was certain they would die if they ran . It had been so long since they 'd seen someone else - * anyone * else . she had thought they were the last . < nl > she was tall - even hunched over as she was , struggling to walk , she guessed she must have been at least seven foot . she clutched something long and curved in her right hand . < nl >  she , ProtagonistD is scared ,  whispered she , clutching ProtagonistD tightly in the crook of her good arm . < nl > she looked at she , sighed , then crouched down until she was eye level with she . Sweat was pouring out from her burning forehead and dribbling down to her torn , lilac tee . It was a sweat that they could n't replace ; there was no water here . There seemed to be no water left on Earth . she gently ran the back of her fingers down her cheek . < nl >  she too , she . But we all need to be brave right now . Whoever is coming , we need their help .   she 're still not better - although , she 'm sure she will be soon ,  she added ,  and , well , we 've not seen * anyone * since ...    her voice trailed off as she thought of their parents . < nl > she bit her lip , looked up at the swirling , tombstone sky above and nodded .  We 'll be brave .  < nl >  Good girl . Make sure she stay behind she , okay ? Let she talk to she ,  she commanded , stepping in front of she .  And if ... anything happens to she . Anything bad , she want she to run as fast as she can , back the way we came .  she turned to face she . she could now make out the ragged cloak that hung loose around the thin body ; the pointed blade that trailed on the desert floor , biting into the earth as it dragged along . But she could n't see the features of the face hidden in the brooding shadow of the hood . < nl >  Hello !  said she , raising a hand . she did n't respond ; she continued trudging toward them . < nl >  We- we do n't mean she harm . her 's sick and we 've not had water for-  < nl > her mouth dropped open when she saw the skeletal feet poking out from the bottom of the cloak .  Oh , Jesus .  Now she was ready to run . she 'd rather die on the radiation plains , her skin peeling and her heart dripping , than let she come any closer . But her curiosity had never been greater ; it took hold of her body and froze it in place . < nl >  * What the fuck are she ? *  she mouthed . < nl > she stopped a few feet from she . she tilted her head to the side , raised a bony hand to her face and peeled back her hood . < nl >  * Oh , shit . * she ,  she said , as she reached behind she , fumbling for her hand ,  get ready to run . Okay ?  < nl >  Pleaaase ,  came the terrible , pleading voice ; it sounded as if it was being dragged through broken glass , as it rose up through her throat . < nl > she poked her head out from behind she . she gasped . < nl >  Pleaaase ,  came the voice again . she raised a hand , her fingers reaching toward them . Then , she collapsed onto her knees , her scythe dropping to the ground . < nl >  Let 's go , okay she ?  said she , trying not to show the fear in her voice . < nl >  ... we ca n't go . she think she needs our help ,  said she .  she 's in pain .  < nl >  Izzy ! What are she doing ?  she hissed , as she slowly walked toward she , until she stood only a foot away from she . < nl >  her name is Izzy ,  she said , before bursting into a cough that ripped her throat and tore at her lungs .   It took she a moment to recover ; she wiped the blood from her lips onto her arm .  This - this is Cibby , and that 's her brother Michael ,  said she .  We do n't have any water , but we have a little food . Would she like some ?  < nl > she stared at she for a moment , before , with what looked like great effort , stretched a hand out toward she . < nl >  Do n't !  shouted she , but it was too late . she had already taken the pale hand in she . < nl > It took only a second for she to fall limply to the ground , ProtagonistD by her side . < nl >  she !  she screamed , running toward she and skidding to the ground next to she .  Oh God , she ,  she said , as snot and hot tears mixed in her mouth . her eyes were shut and her chest was perfectly still .  Please do n't be dead . * Please please please . *  she shook she gently at first , then more firmly , then urgently . But she did n't respond . she did n't move . < nl > she picked up ProtagonistD , and placed ProtagonistD into her limp , open hand . Then , she buried her head into her chest and wept . < nl > she slowly got back to her feet . she bent down and picked up her scythe . < nl >  What did she do to she , you- you * monster ! *  she asked , her voice trembling as she turned to she .  she was just a little girl and you-  < nl > she saw her left arm move first . The arm that had n't moved since the mines . < nl >  * What ? * she ?  < nl > her eyes slowly opened . The trace of a smile curved over her lips . < nl >  she !  she repeated through sobs and laughter .  Oh God , she , she 're alive . Please - * please , * do n't ever do that to she again .  she kissed her cheeks a dozen times , and her forehead nearer a hundred , before hugging she tightly . < nl >  she ... she made she better ,  she said , as she finally released she , raising her neck and looking up at she . < nl > she stared anew at she . she looked stronger now . Taller , too . It took she a few moments to be able to whisper :  * thank she * .  < nl > she nodded , before lifting her scythe high into the air . < nl >  What are she ...  < nl > she brought the instrument down fiercely , tip first , burying it deep into the dry earth . A fountain of clear liquid erupted from the hole as she withdrew it . It did n't take long for a soft blanket of grass to begin sprouting underneath she , quickly spreading out as if it was a puddle of water . It did n't take long for she to find the first tulip that had grown in a hundred years . Then , the first apple tree . < nl > she whispered to she and pressed something into her hands . < nl > When she was finally satisfied by the sparkling oasis , she pointed a finger toward she and gestured for she to step forward . she did so . < nl >  she wanted she to have ProtagonistD ,  she said , offering out a hand . < nl > she paused for a moment , unsure , before reaching out and taking ProtagonistD . she looked at ProtagonistD curiously , turning ProtagonistD over twice . Then , she dropped ProtagonistD into a deep , dark pocket on the side of her cloak .  There are others ,  she said , in a soft rumble .  Only a few . she must bring them here .  < nl >  How - how will she find them ?  < nl >  she will ,  she replied .  she will be safe , here . Nothing evil can step foot into her garden .  she turned and took three steps away from she , before pausing .  she will see she again , someday ,  she whispered , not quite loud enough for she to hear . Then , she continued her slow walk into the dancing dust of the desert . < nl >  Thank she ,  she whispered , as she drifted out of sight . < nl > --- < nl > more on /r / nickofnight < eos > 
< sos > They packed and left once more . < nl > Alice sighed as they did it , looking back from the ramp at the gold - green horizon , pierced all through with falling stars , all aflame . The world groaned and hissed . she felt the slateland below her feet shimmy and quake . < nl > Another home lost . < nl > On the ship , she settled into a corner , not helping , a passive protest of the situation . Carol set a crate at her feet . < nl >  Do n't pout . It 's the start of another adventure .  < nl > she shook off her optimism , diving into the crate .  What 's this ?  she said , pulling up a binder , corroded , yellow and warped . < nl >  Careful ,  said she .  Those are pictures . Old , old pictures .  < nl >  Of * what * ?  said she , flipping open the pages .  What are these things ? < nl > she laughed , settling in beside she .  It 's us . From before .  < nl > she shook her head .  No it is n't . This is ... she do n't know * what * this is . Look how silly they look . How ... ugly .  < nl > she shrugged .  We did n't think so then .  she pointed at an image .  That 's me .  < nl > she pulled back , staring in disbelief .  No it is n't ! Look at the ... she mean ...  < nl >  This is what we were in the beginning ,  said she .  Those were perfect bodies for Earth . Slim , light , nimble . Adapted to the atmosphere . she miss those bodies sometimes ...  < nl >  What 's wrong with * these * bodies ?  said she , looking down at she . < nl >  Nothing ! Not a thing . But she must remember we 've been so many places , she . And they were all so different . We 've made changes along the way to suit each and every new home . See here ...  < nl > she put a gentle finger on the trio of exposed ridges across her bare chest .  On Calais - she remember Calais ? - we formed these slits in order to help us breathe . The old way would n't have done . And here ...  < nl > she traced the edge of the thin membranous flap that ran along the length of her forearm .  There was hardly any solid land on Galway . We had to adapt . We 're always adapting . Even the bare shape of us . The gravity was much , much harsher on Fulsome . We grew stouter because we had to . The old us would 've snapped right in half .  < nl > she nodded . she remembered some of these places , and she supposed she remembered some of these changes , but they had n't felt like changes . Looking back , they seemed a natural progression .  This part looks stupid ,  she said , resting a finger on the part of the image that showed a flowing , black wave riding down from the top of her head . < nl > Again , she laughed .  It was the style . her father certainly loved her long hair , impractical as it may have been .  she touched the silvery , solid webbing that sat like a shield atop her head .  We could be impractical then , though . The radiation was different . No threat of black flares .  she sighed .  she guess things were a bit simpler then .  < nl >  Better ?  said she . < nl >  No ,  said she , running a loving finger across the outer rim of her folded wings .  Just different . That 's what comes of survival , she suppose . You must always be willing to become .  < nl >  Become what ?  said she . < nl > she smirked .  Whatever you must .  she took back the binder and set it in the crate .  Back to work , she . This world is no longer ours .  < nl > she staggered up to her feet .  she hate living out in the black .  < nl >  The black is just an interlude ,  said she .  It reminds us to appreciate those times when we have solid earth to call our own .  < nl > she understood , even if she preferred not to agree . she gathered up the last of her possessions - the ones that would come with them into the black - and said goodbye to her dying home . It was sad , but necessary , she realized . That 's just how survival works . < eos > 
< sos > The experiment with Carol had perhaps gotten out of hand . If any of Alice's supervisors heard of it , it would be difficult to explain why on earth she found it reasonable to give she impossibly difficult tests while the others were quizzed on only the basic classroom curriculum . < nl > The answer would never suffice , despite its truth : * because she would get them all correct * . < nl > her minor case study began when she accidentally listed the Second Punic War as the Carthaginian War on her ninth graders ' tests . Every student understandably missed the question -- few fourteen - year - olds , it seemed , read the * Aeneid * these days and would place Carthage as an ancient African city -- except she . she listed the correct dates in her blocky , imperfect handwriting . < nl > she asked she about it later . < nl > she only shrugged and said ,  she just know a lot of stuff .  she looked uncomfortable and scurried away . < nl > she then started slipping questions into her tests which none of the children could possibly be expected to answer . Who was involved in the defenestration of Prague ? Which Russian ruler died in 1584 under the title  Tsar of all the Russias  ? What is the cosine of this triangle ? Can she balance this chemical formula ? < nl > she almost wanted to accuse she of cheating . But she kept a razor - sharp eye on she during tests , and her hands never strayed under the table or into her pockets . she simply filled out her test , handed it in halfway through the period , and then sat with her head on her desk until she was free to go to her next class . < nl > Then she perhaps pushed it too far . < nl > Yesterday , she gave all but one of her students a test on Sophocles 's * Oedipus Rex * , which they were reading as a part of their ancient Greek unit . It asked them the basics of the plot and the play 's intended messages . < nl > For she , her test was more ... open - ended . < nl > she left a single sticky note on her test to explain she : * This , * she wrote , * is not a test of her knowledge but of her critical thinking . she are an excellent student and she know she do not need to test her basic comprehension . Have fun and think clearly . * < nl > Now she sat at her desk in her apartment living room with a glass of red wine and a stack of tests before she . she rifled through until she found her near the bottom . her sticky note still remained on her paper ; she had simply written  Okay :)  on the bottom . < nl > she smiled , despite she . < nl > she only gave she four questions . she gave she the choice to answer in the context of the play or to simply derive her answers from her own experiences . Credit was not for the accuracy of her answers but their depth . < nl > * What is good ? * < nl > * What is just ? * < nl > * What is fate ? * < nl > * What is the purpose to life itself ? * < nl > she had n't answered any of them . her test page was blank , except for an arrow at the bottom , urging she to turn the paper over . < nl > she frowned and did so . On the back she found a dense wall of her sloppy , childish handwriting . she took a deep sip of wine before reading . < nl > * Respectfully , she , I think her questions are built up on false assumptions . she 're asking for ice when the world is water and air , always moving and mixing . It 's a singularly human notion to turn ideas into something condensed , portable , and easy to wrap one 's mind around . But it 's not honest . * < nl > * she are asking questions which lack answers because the questions themselves are wrongly put . It is not about rigid , inflexible meaning which exists in its own right , waiting to be dissected for an essay question . Purpose and answers arise from our own perceptions . If she think there is no good then all the world will be black and hopeless . If she think an eye for an eye is justice she stumble through your life blind with righteous indignation . * < nl > * But if you care and hope and love , the world is full of small beautiful things , always working together , always persisting against the selfish and chaotic . We can be grotesque and sublime all at once if we never let the former outweigh the latter in our minds . * < nl > * she 'm sorry if it 's not the answers she wanted she , but please do n't fail she . she 've never failed a test before . * < nl > she wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes . she did not know what she had been expecting . There was comfort in the idea that there existed someone who knew all things . Part of she was disappointed that she was just another fact - hoarding bookworm . < nl > But it seemed she was just as clueless as anyone else when it came to life 's truly crippling problems . Or exponentially more brilliant . she had not decided which yet . she only knew she needed another drink . < nl > * * * < nl > /r / shoringupfragments < nl > Edit : holy shit thank she she have never been gilded before < eos > 
< sos >  Some tea , Alice ?  Carol asked to she . she squinted at she having forgotten her glasses upstairs . < nl >  Yes , earthling ,  she boomed and whispered all at once , careful not to burst her delicate eardrums with her natural voice as she had with the last earthling she 'd met . < nl >  Call she Grammy ,  she said , and set about preparing the kettle to boil after setting a plate of cookies on the table . < nl >  Yes , she ,  she corrected she .  Thank she ,  she added as a stilted afterthought . < nl > --- < nl > Elva typed the word  dear  into her database . < nl >  Dear : an affectionate term referring to one who is figuratively close to the speaker , such as a family member or an old friend .  < nl > she ran her hand through her tendrils and sighed . < nl >  Agent from Earth sector 9 reporting ,  she whispered into her communicator .  Advise immediate shelving of phase two . she repeat , advise to abort phase two .  < nl > The response rang clear over the comm channel :  Report received , she . Mission briefing in two cycles .  < nl >  Acknowledged .  < nl >  Did she say something , she ?  she asked , turning toward she with a pleasant smile on her old and weathered face . < nl >  Not at all , she ,  she said .  Thank she for the cookies .  < eos > 
< sos > Alice sat down on the sidewalk , shaking a jug of coins at the bypassing people . she did n't have a name or face because this story took place in a world without a proper setting or forethought , words were scarce and descriptions suffered in turn . The only things that existed were her immense fortune somewhere out in the ether , and the busy street , which was the scene of the story . < nl > Not too surprisingly , Carol walked up to she . Let 's call she she , I mean , who really cares about her name . What matters is that she was a struggling single mother . she was several months behind on her rent , and her landlord was evicting she . she also had a daughter that was very ill - chronically so - and did n't have money for proper treatment . < nl > Seeing she on the street , dressed in nothing but rags , made she stop . No matter how rough things got , there were always people who had it worse . she was just about to give she her last spare change , when something unbelievable happened - something that was n't in the script . she noticed Elva . < nl > Now a new dilemma presented itself to she . she had her arm stretched out and ready to drop the coin into the jug of she , but she hesitated . she probably needed the money more than she . Could she change her mind in this situation ? Was that the right thing to do ? The expression of mixed happiness and surprise on her face made her heart ache . What would she see in her gray eyes if she pulled her hand back ? Disappointment ? Hatred ? < nl > her eyes wandered to the dime in her hand . Could she ask ProtagonistD if ProtagonistD could change it for two nickels so that she could give them one each ? That seemed very out of line to she . < nl >  Just drop it in she ,  she said with a look at she .  she 'll be better off from it as well .  < nl > she was a bit taken aback by the bold statement . It was such a blunt thing to say . How would she be better off if she gave the money to she ? That seemed like such a messed up idea - she was clearly starving . < nl >  she , uh , she ...  she said and finally pulled her hand back . < nl > she shook her head at she , and she sniffed . she dropped the coin into the open palm of she and hurried off . The problem with this course of action , even though it seemed morally right to she , was that she still had n't received help . < nl > Now , if she had been a proper character with a bit of depth , she would 've realized that she was a good person anyway , and hurried after she to give she her fortune . I mean , why did it have to be to she in the first place ? If someone gave a starving child money , would n't they be deserving of the fairytale ending in this scenario ? If she had any sense of morality , she would n't be out on the streets playing games to see who gets her fortune . she would 've helped all the homeless children in the city . she would 've distributed food and helped people out of the gutter . < nl > But since this is not a proper setting or characterization , just a random scene with a made up scenario , ProtagonistE walked by . ProtagonistE was Michael Foroza , a crime lord that preyed upon the weak and exploited those with good intentions . ProtagonistE was the man who was evicting she and she . And while digging through ProtagonistE's pocket for ProtagonistE's phone to call in another hit on an innocent person , a random coin dropped out and accidentally landed in her jug . < nl > * * * * < nl > r / Lilwa_Dexel < eos > 
< sos >  What brings Alice here she ?  < nl > Elva stared at she . she was about seven with big blue eyes and a mass of dark blonde hair . her clothes were worn but clean and had been mended . The pink back pack and matching lunch box looked new . < nl >  Carol and she were walking to school when a big crowd separated us and now she ca n't find she . her name is Sylvia . Can she help she find she ?  her heart nearly melted at her request .  How about she take she to the police station . They can find she .  she replied . she grabbed her hand as her stomach growled loudly . she looked up at she and sniffled . < nl >  Are she hungry she ? she can share her lunch with she .  < nl >  she could n't take her food she . she need it for school .  < nl >  she packed two sandwiches in case she have a classmate who does n't have a lunch . she 're not a classmate but she do n't have a sandwich .  < nl > she dug around her little lunchbox and pulled out a turkey sandwich with cheese and a juice box . Smiling , she handed it to she . she was touched . After spending weeks on the street waiting for someone to show she some kindness , she put them to shame by offering a sandwich . she took the sandwich and juice with a word of thanks and bit into it . < nl >  Thank she she . she are very kind at such a young age .  < nl >  she has always taught she to be kind to others . she always keeps snacks and stuff in her car or bag for people in need .  < nl >  Wise words to live by .  < nl > she finished the sandwich and juice and was about to start the walk to the police department when she heard tearful and frantic yelling . ProtagonistD came running down the street calling her name . she got ProtagonistD's attention and ProtagonistD came to the duo . < nl >  Sylvia ! ProtagonistD's sweet baby . ProtagonistD was so scared that ProtagonistD lost she ! Are she okay ?  The emotions in ProtagonistD's voice showed that ProtagonistD was truly worried about she . < nl >  she 'm fine she . she was going to help she find she . she please quit squishing she .  < nl > ProtagonistD laughed and let she go . ProtagonistD then stood up and turned ProtagonistD's attention to she . < nl >  How can ProtagonistD ever repay she she ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD already have . Now it is ProtagonistD's turn to repay she .  < eos > 
< sos >  You live like this ?  Alice asked , gently waking me up . < nl > I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling .    Yeah .  < nl > she walked across the room and started rummaging through my dresser .   Casually dropping socks and some receipts on the floor .   I was n't sure why the receipts were in there , I had n't bought anything in years . < nl > she muttered .    Bunch of crap , nothing worth taking .  < nl > I sighed and sat up , sliding my legs off the bed and onto Carol .   she snorted and rolled over .   Useless damn thing .   Just lets someone walk into my room .   I rubbed her belly with my bare foot .   her tongue lolled out the side of her pug face .   she snorted again contentedly . < nl >  What are she looking for ?  < nl > she looked over her shoulder and glared at me before answering .    Dunno , something worth taking she guess .  < nl >  Take she , she 's worthless .  < nl > I got up and headed to the kitchen , she continued to rummage around in my room .   I made coffee .   she followed me and headed to her bowl .   she is always hungry .   I ignored it , did n't have anything for she anyway . < nl > The day was grey with a slight drizzle , but it was bright enough I could see my way around .   I left the light off , figured she would prefer that .   Something crashed and broke in the bathroom .   I grabbed the coffee off the machine and took a careful sip .   Stuffs hot right when it comes off the machine . < nl >  What the hell are she doing ?   Breaking my bathroom up ?  < nl > I leaned around the corner and peered down the hall , a shadow moved there , she had turned on the bathroom light .   she   Loud as hell and now turning on lights . < nl > her head poked through the bathroom door .   she was pretty , if a bit angular and gawky .   she sneered which made she much less pretty . < nl >  Maybe .   Maybe she 'll break you up too and take everything  . < nl > I chuckled and that seemed to irritate she more .   Then I laughed out loud and she trotted over and sat in the hallway looking at she , and then at me .   she glared at us both .   I shrugged and went back in the kitchen , she did whatever dogs do when you are n't looking at them .   she cursed and I heard she coming down the hall . < nl > she walked in the kitchen with she in tow .    she smell coffee .  < nl >  Yeah , she ca n't function without it , robbery or no , it 's hard to deal with the mornings until she have some .  < nl > she looked through the refrigerator .    Bloody hell , what 's in this Tupperware ?  < nl > I looked up from my coffee , French Roast , it was delicious .    Who knows , she have n't opened that thing up in months .  < nl > she put it back quickly and closed the door .   she seemed defeated and sat heavily on the only other chair in the kitchen .   I considered telling she it only had three of its four legs .   But hey , she was trying to rob me , let she figure it out .   The result was predictable , she went down in a heap , flat on her back .   The chair now had one and a half legs .   It startled she .   she jumped up and walked over to where she lay , staring at the ceiling , and started licking her face . < nl > I leaned over and peered down at her , steaming cup of coffee in my hand . < nl >  she live like this ?  < nl >  Yeah  she said , staring at the ceiling . < eos > 
< sos > Alice's stomach growled aggressively as she pushed past the crest of the hill , leaning heavily on the metal stick she carried in one hand . For a second , her eyes lit up with expectation before turning ash gray once more . The sand stretched out for miles , the sight of great buildings on the horizon the only thing convincing she the sands did not simply continue forever . she sighed heavily , her hot breath starting to fog up her goggles , as she began her methodical descent down the hill . The earth was hard and dense as her boots struggled to dig into it , forcing she to spend several seconds for every step , making sure she would n't fall again . It was slow and grueling , but she eventually made it down , sinking shallowly into the cold sand . < nl > she found she missing the hard stone of her homeland , something she never thought she would say . It was tough and cold , but at the very least it was reliable , something she desperately wished for as the winds kicked up whatever stray sand had not already frozen in place . Digging her face deeper into her collar , she started making her way toward the lone skeleton of a building in front of she , buried halfway into the sands . < nl > Stepping behind a large concrete wall shielding she from the wind , she pressed she back against it and slid down into a sitting position with a sigh . she had traded her last Potato for this information , but feeling warmth finally return to her face made it feel more than worth it . she sat there for a while , resting , and trying to warm she up a bit . But most importantly she was trying to stay awake . she had seen many people stronger than she , succumb to the sleeping death of the desert and was not about to make the same mistake . No matter how heavy her eyes felt . < nl > she jolted awake , not knowing if she had been sleeping for two hours or two seconds , and terrified of both scenarios . she attempted to slow her breathing , looking around the broken room for something to focus on . In one corner was lay the bones of some man or beast that had at one point had the same idea as she , perhaps foreshadowing her own demise . Another corner was charred as if by fire and it made she long for the warm fires she had left to continue her travels . And lastly , in the corner directly to her right , there was some piece of scrap metal sticking out of the sand . she stared at it , wondering what it could have been for . Maybe a skyscraper that reached high into the clouds , or a ship that could ferry she out into the abyss . < nl > she jolted again , this time catching she before her eyes had fully closed , and begrudgingly pushed she off the ground . Joints aching violently , she made her way over to the scrap metal , thankful for the boost that even just walking gave her concentration . It looked strange when you were this close to it , less like scrap and more like a container , perhaps containing something of value ? It took her maybe ten minutes to dig out the case enough for she to remove it with brute force . It was n't that large , maybe 15 inches across , and she could n't spot any kind of physical lock . < nl > Flipping the case open , there was a matt black rectangle sitting snugly inside the padding , accompanied by a much smaller rectangle attached to its side . Carefully removing the rectangle from its casing she found that it opened up to reveal a keyboard underneath , letters she did n't recognize mixed in with familiar symbols . It was a computer and , as she found out from the lights turning on in unison , a working one . As the operating system flashed onto the screen she chuckled to she about how long ago it must have been when this was made . < nl > There were three profiles , one had a picture of a suitcase , one had a picture of a painting , and one had a picture of a robot action figure . Clicking on the suitcase she was taken to a white page with black text . Of course , she could n't read any of it , but there were still some pictures around . On one side she noticed that there were a lot of different symbols forming similar words , and tried looking for her own language , but to no avail . Instead , she just clicked around using an antiquated trackpad , marveling at some of the images . < nl > Eventually , she got to a page that that had an image of a field . But it was not like any field she had ever seen . It was lush and green , flowers of different colors adorning the grass that almost swayed before her very eyes . It was n't there to feed anyone , was n't there to be built upon . It just existed , beautiful and green , right there on the page . And she cried as it all faded to black and the batteries gave out , leaving behind she freezing in the desert , alone . < eos > 
< sos >  What about the public ?  Alice said .  she 've always been open about things .  < nl > Carol sucked on her lower lip intensely and looked at she , and then over at Elva . < nl >  The public is not ready for something like this ,  she said . < nl >  How are we supposed to fund a journey like this in secret ? Alpha Canis Majoris is 2.6 parsecs away - that 's , uh , over eight light years .  < nl > she finally rose from her seat and hurried over to the screen . With a few quick sweeps and taps of her fingers , she drew up the plans for the project . When she first started studying marine biology , she never thought she 'd be working on something like this . Two of the world 's most powerful men relied directly on she for a project that would cost ... she did n't even want to think about the numbers . < nl > A solar system popped up on the screen . The white main - sequence star of spectral type at the center , known as Sirius A , was twice as large as our own sun . The system around it looked very different , as well , with another star , a white dwarf called Sirius B , orbiting the center of the system . NASA had spent the last year trying to gather as much information about the system as possible , and nearly all resources had been funneled into the project . Strings had even been pulled with the government , and part of the military funding now went straight into NASA 's pocket . < nl > The model of the solar system on the screen shifted and zoomed in on a bright blue planet . After decoding the whale song , she had spent many nights awake , thinking about the implications . she had always thought about night sky 's reflection in the sea - the only mirror able to hold the universe on its shiny surface - and it did n't feel all too strange that some of the creatures living there would somehow be connected to vast expanses of space . < nl >  So , that 's where we 're going ?  she said and rose from her seat as well . < nl >  she take it she 're interested then ,  she said and joined the other two . < nl >  Of course , she just wish she 'd told she sooner .  < nl > The two men shook hands , and her lips turned into a smile of relief . Getting she and SpaceX on board was crucial and had likely been a significant stress factor to she for quite some time now . Their technology on rapid space travel would be crucial for this expedition . < nl >  she 'm happy you 've decided to join us , let 's set up the meetings as soon as possible .  < nl > she nodded .  she just have one question : who 'll be the head of this mission ? Who will lead the expedition ?  < nl > she threw out her wrinkly hand and sat back down in the armchair .  her number one pick would be she .  < nl > her eyes went wide .  B - but she do n't have any astronaut training ; she 'm just-  < nl >  Of course ,  she cut she off excitedly ,  she . A fine choice !  < nl > her heart was racing now . she 'd never been out of the country before , and she felt like there must be hundreds , if not thousands , of people more qualified than she . she thought about ProtagonistD , and wondered who 'd take care of ProtagonistD if she left for ... another solar system . < nl >  What do she say , she ?  she said . < nl > she swallowed and took a deep breath . Was she ready for this ? What would her mother say ? she played the scenario in her head : ' Hey , Mom , she 'm going to Sirius for a bit - don't expect she back before Christmas . ' The look on her mother 's face would be a combination of pride and sadness . < nl > On a mission like this ... well , she would n't be returning to Earth , that much was certain . Still , the discovery of the meaning behind the whale song made she shiver . she had to go . < nl >  she 'd be honored ,  she said and bowed slightly . < nl >  Then it 's settled !  she said .  she can start picking out her team , she - she , let 's continue our talk in private - she have a few propositions she 'd like to run by she .  < nl > The two men left the room , and she found her eyes wandering to the massive clock that adorned the wall . One year and two days left to launch . she was about to leave Earth forever - the thought was dizzying - and the journey there would take so long ... she 'd be close to forty when they finally reached Alpha Canis Majoris . she could n't quite wrap her head around it . she was nineteen now , and by the end of the journey , she would 've spent more time on board that space ship than on Earth . < nl > Still shaky from the unexpected news , she turned off the computer and plugged her earphones in . The shrill but soft sounds , echoing through the ocean filled her mind . The song was beautiful and sad - emotions that perfectly portrayed the meanings behind it . < nl > * * * * < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / Lilwa_Dexel / comments/6w4j6y / the_song_of_sirius_part_2/ ) < nl > r / Lilwa_Dexel for more . < eos > 
< sos > Once upon a time there was Alice . she woke up one morning feeling as shameful as ever , but something was ... different . she felt a little less lonely than usual , as if she was sharing the house with a close and trustworthy friend . she went to the kitchen to fix she something along the line of breakfast . she opened the cereal cupboard , expecting her usual stale and tasteless dehydrated oats ; however , in its place was pancake mix and healthy , albeit sugary , cereal ! < nl > she was astounded , no , bewildered to find this . she danced around the kitchen , then stopped , the colour in her face draining . she realized that somebody would have needed to have broken into her house , noticed her situation , gone shopping and then put the products in her cupboard . she thought about calling the police , but decided to hold back from doing so , doubting anybody would believe she . she got the pancake mix and added water from her tap and made a breakfast she had never imagined she could have ever gotten to eat . Although she could taste the dirt from the tap water , she was unfazed . < nl > After brekfast , she went to take a shower , and saw some good old , white and cleaning soap on the rest thing in her shower .  That s fucking weird  she said .  Not only did she have pancake mix for she but now soap ?  Now she was starting to feel uncomfortale . she smelled the soap . Although pungent , it reminded she of the soap in Carol's bathroom when she lived with she during her teen years . she wetted it in her sink and scrubbed it on her left palm , then washed it off , some of the dirt on her hand had already washed off ! < nl > she got in the fuckin showr and got she clean . she said to she  wow , she wonder who got she this , it 's like she have a gardian angel or somethin . After getting out of the shower she saw Elva in her mirror .  Hello ?  she asked . she replied to she  hello she . she have been sent by God to protect and care for she .  < nl > Holy fuckin shit can she belive this ? she got agoddamb angle savin her and shit ! she got out of the mirror and held her hand .  Do nt touch she she  said she , cuz its clearly not the fuckin angel talking , now is it ? she helped she get dressed . she 's a guy angel , okay ? Why , she ask ? Cuz she said so ! she walkd she out of the bathroom and they watched tv . < nl > Dam sad she . she got some good shows on here . The girl and she watched the tv for a bit . God , what an she doing with her life ? A girl and angle watchng tv ? Why did she even start writing this ! You know what , fuck it ! she 'm gon na go take a nap ... < eos > 
< sos >  Alice just do n't see why it has to have holes everywhere .  she gestured at the gap in the middle of the platemail .  Wo n't she get stabbed in the stomach ?  < nl >  Oh , no . You see , our armor is very high level . It gives +15 resistance against piercing . That 's much better than the iron plate you picked up off the bandit 's hideout ,  I explained , throwing a dagger at the stomach - hole . It bounced off .  Materials are short , so the holes are necessary . We made sure to put them in areas where they 'd keep you properly ventilated .  < nl > Carol shoved she aside and slammed her hands on the counter .  SPEEDRUN !  she shouted , and I scrambled to bring out a bag of standard gear . she grabbed half of it , tossed her entire coin pouch on the table , and ran outside before she could get up . < nl >  Sorry about that . Anyway , if she 're concerned about the safety of this piece , we have many others available for her selection .  I pointed at the displays on the wall . < nl >  Is n't that one just lingerie ?  she asked , pointing at the far left stand with a golden pedestal . < nl >  Do n't worry about that one , it costs premium currency and does n't provide any armor . So yeah , it basically is just lingerie . We sell it too . Well , if she 're looking for something a little better covered , our Nightress set does n't have any holes .  she examined the set of pitch black medium armor . < nl >  It 's a little better , but why does it have boobs ? Wo n't she fracture her sternum if she fall over ? You sure she ca n't just wear male armor ?  I sighed and brought out a set of male armor . < nl >  Well , if she insist , she can try this . It 's the standard male counterpart for her level , though it might feel a bit uncomfortable . 4000 gold .  I set it on the counter . < nl >  It 's pretty expensive , but oh well . Whatever lets she keep her dignity .  she fished around in her pouch .  Damn , she 'm only at 3800 . Let she sell some equipment really quick .  < nl > she slid her money , her sword , her boots , her pants , and her bandit plate mail across the counter and walked out completely naked carrying the male armor . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > [ more](https://www.reddit.com / r / Tensingstories/ ) < eos > 
< sos > The rowdy crowd rabbled . They rabbled in a rowdier manner than any rowdy crowd had rabbled before . < nl >  Order ! Order within this hall !  shouted Mr. Hanner , the mayor of Stubbornsville . His voice reverberating around the rickety old hall . < nl > The gathered crowd was a ragtag bunch . Mainly dressed in old potato bags , mud , and , in some cases , old potato bags made of mud . They were also difficult to control and were prone to mob fever . But the rowdiness was quickly put to bed when the doors to the hall burst open . < nl > Alice , atop of the tallest horse the villagers had ever seen , entered and slowly trotted towards the front of the hall stopping just short of   the stage . she unseated and descended from her high horse , slowly walking up the steps to the front of the stage . < nl >  Greetings , peasants ,  said she , lifting her arms aloft to greet the crown in a demeaning manner .  she come from the future and she 'm here to tell you just how much better she am than you .  < nl > The crowd did n't react . They just looked on confused . < nl >  Thought the whole future thing would have got a bigger reaction but let 's move on ,  said she , pacing around the stage .  How can she be a superior person just like you , she hear you ask . Well , she have one word for you : Veganism ,  said she , in an incredibly condescending and preachy tone . < nl >  Are she the person who has been putting all those pictures of gross dead animals on the bulletin board ?  asked one of the gathered peasants .  The pictures with the words on top and bottom .  < nl >  Yes , that was she ,  announced she , clearly proud of the fact .  she assume this has already converted hundreds of you to her way of thinking as it is a fool - proof strategy in the year 2017 .  < nl >  The pictures on the bulletin board worked on Carol ,  admitted she .  she could only stomach half of her dog after seeing one of the pictures .  < nl > she looked towards Elva ,  Wait , why are her people eating dogs ?  < nl >  Why are she eating her dogs , she ?  asked she , looking to get to the bottom of this case . < nl >  The dog was organic if that makes a difference ,  said she . < nl >  No ,  said she .  No that does not make a difference .  < nl >  Are cats OK to eat if her veganism ?  another voice queried from the crowd .  I tend to eat cats .  < nl >  she really does eat a lot of cats ,  added she . < nl >  No . Why would cats be OK if dogs are not ? Veganism is about not eating any meat at all thus making you a superior person ,  explained she . < nl >  I do n't understand ,  shouted a voice from the crowd . < nl >  What part do you not understand ?  asked she . < nl > The peasant woman in the crowd stood up ,  I do n't understand how not eating meat makes she a better person .  < nl >  Humans do not need to consume meat ,  explained she .  And by not eating meat , animals get to live free from cages allowing people like she to feel smug and better than others .  < nl >  Can we eat animal if they are eating us ?  asked the peasant lady who was still standing .  ProtagonistD stole my child . ProtagonistD knocked at door pretending to be kind neighbour . But it was all lie . A dirty bear lie .  < nl >  There 's just no way that 's true ,  said she . < nl >  she 'm afraid it 's true . It was easily a top 5 case of child being eaten by ProtagonistD ,  said she , following up .  Some actually said top 3 but it was never agreed upon .  < nl >  Listen , we 're getting off track here , the idea is to not eat any animals under any circumstance . That is what separates us vegans from those who are quite clearly below us .  < nl >  Are there any other ways we can feel superior to others while still eating meat ?  asked she .  she just do n't feel like veganism is going to work in this village .  < nl > she began to pace , deep in thought .  The issue is , it 's difficult to be smugger than being vegan but there is something else . By a show of hands , how many of you exercise ?  < nl > Around twenty hands went up in to the air . < nl >  So about a quarter of you exercise . That 's good . Now , how many of you make sure you tell others about your exercising ?  < nl > Every hand fell back down . < nl >  You see ,  said she ,  how do you expect to feel better than others if you 're not obnoxiously showing everyone how much better than them you are ?  < nl >  ProtagonistE's name Boris . ProtagonistE feel better after run ,  said ProtagonistE , shouting from the back . < nl >  Come on up , ProtagonistE ,  said she , with ProtagonistE obliging .  When did ProtagonistE go on ProtagonistE's run ?  < nl >  Today ,  replied ProtagonistE . < nl >  And how many people are aware ProtagonistE went on ProtagonistE's run ?  < nl >  Zero .  < nl >  ProtagonistE , what is the point of improving ProtagonistE if ProtagonistE are n't forcing it down the throats of people who are n't bothered ? ProtagonistE 're missing a key element of being better than everyone else . Take this piece of paper and write ' Would n't be able to live with ProtagonistE if ProtagonistE did n't get out and run every day . Attack the day ! '  < nl > ProtagonistE wrote the message . < nl >  Now pin it to that wall over there .  < nl > ProtagonistE walked over to the wall in the hall next to the stage and pinned up the message . < nl >  Everyone look at that message ,  shouted she . < nl > Everyone turned to view the message . < nl >  Now , ProtagonistE , how do ProtagonistE feel knowing all of these people now know ProtagonistE went on ProtagonistE's run ?  < nl > ProtagonistE looked at the crowd viewing ProtagonistE's message ,  It makes ProtagonistE feel above them .  < nl >  That 's it !  shouted she ,  This is what she 'm telling you . It 's not the exercise , the unwillingness to eat meat , or the genuine efforts to improve yourself that 's important ; it 's letting other people know you 're better than them that is the key .  < nl >  I get it !  shouted a familiar voice from the crowd .  So all I have to do is let other people know I have eaten their dog .  < nl > * * * * < nl > she write shitty , silly stories on /r / BillMurrayMovies . Feel free to come along , not laugh at any of them and leave some judgement . < eos > 
< sos >  All in favour of sparing Elva's life , step forward !  < nl > I looked around the village square , but no one moved a muscle . The seconds rolled by , and the hope I held in my heart crumbled , only to be replaced by a sharp tang of bitterness , resentment . There was Alice , but she kept her eyes down , lips tightly pursed . I saw Carol , but she was as silent , unmoving as she was . < nl > Old Man Bosworth , the twins Jaina and Jerry , Valerie , Daniel ... they too , everyone who had ever benefited in one way or the other from her help , all suddenly bereft of courage , unwilling to stand up for she . < nl > The bloody ingrates . < nl >  Do she see how everyone fears she , she ?  asked ProtagonistD , shaking ProtagonistD's staff at she .  We tolerated she , gave she a place to call home , and this is how she repay us ? By bringing this evil magic into our village ?  < nl >  she am not evil ,  she said , her voice carrying to the edges of the crowd .  she have done no harm to the village . she have only helped .  < nl >  Helped ? Helped ?  said ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD's voice rising in anger . ProtagonistD turned to the crowd , stretched out ProtagonistD's arms , then said ,  Evil fears the light , she . ProtagonistD shall show the village proof , proof of her heresy ! ProtagonistD will show them the forbidden evils we found in her hut ! Come , show them !  < nl > Fred and Richard , two of the strongest farmers in the village , retrieved a wooden chest from within ProtagonistD's hut . They struggled even though the load was shared between them , and after they placed the evidence in front of she , they took hurried steps backwards , leaving ProtagonistD the honour of opening the chest . < nl > ProtagonistD rummaged briefly , then retrieved what appeared to be a marble slate , dark and smooth on one side , white and pristine on the other . ProtagonistD held it triumphantly in the air , revelling in the reactions ProtagonistD was getting . < nl >  Has anyone ever seen a rock like this ?  ProtagonistD asked .  ProtagonistD promise you , no one has !  < nl >  It 's not right of ProtagonistD to have gone into her hut like that ,  said she . < nl >  Oh ? And if ProtagonistD had not done so , if ProtagonistD had not suspected she of carrying out the dark one 's work , would ProtagonistD ever have discovered foul things such as this ?  < nl >  she do n't know what ProtagonistD are talking abou-  < nl > ProtagonistD squeezed the edges of the slate , and one side of it flared to life , emitting vibrant colours , as if someone had managed to trap a rainbow in stone . The crowd gasped , and I saw some of the adults shielding their children 's eyes . < nl >  If ProtagonistD had not been suspicious , if ProtagonistD had not known to spy on she , would ProtagonistD have discovered her secrets , she ?  said ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD turned the slate towards us , then said ,  Listen ! Listen with your own ears ! This is she ! she ! Listen to the unholy mission she is on !  < nl > ProtagonistD need n't have commanded us in that manner . We were enraptured , spellbound by the moving images on the slate , of what appeared to a ... doppelganger of she , staring out at us , speaking to us . I heard whispers rise up , words like  impossible  ,  there 's two of she  ,  a soul , trapped in marble  . < nl > We fell silent though , once she began speaking . < nl >  42nd entry - no new developments in weeks . The search goes on ,  she said . her unruly hair was tied back , and there was a steadiness to her voice , a clarity to her eyes which was n't usually there . she was not the Matilda we knew , the soft - minded , chattering and hyperactive Matilda we saw roaming the village from morning to night . < nl > It began to dawn on me that it was all an act . < nl >  she do n't understand !  said she , throwing up her hands .  The historical records are clear ! The Influencer came from these parts , and she have narrowed it down to this village ! she did not travel this far back in time in vain ! Yet ... yet she have met with all of them , talked to each and every one , but no one , no one stands out ! she have run her tests , checked her equipment over and over , but still , not a single one displays even a modicum of psychic powe-  < nl >  And these are her tools , by her own admission !  yelled ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD kicked the chest over , and its contents spilled across the ground , next to she . An excited hum rose amongst the crowds as they feasted their eyes on the unnatural objects , the shiny , glinty collection of baubles created by her own hands . < nl >  Answer ProtagonistD !  ProtagonistD continued , striking ProtagonistD's staff into the ground for emphasis .  Tell ProtagonistD why ProtagonistD should not have she burned here , right where she are !  < nl > she raised her head , stared straight at the crowd . Most of them still had the decency to shuffle and squirm , but still no one intervened . < nl >  she have done no harm to anyone ,  said she .  It is true , she kept secret the real reason why she was here , and she did not tell anyone why it is that she know what she know . But she have only meant well . she have shared her medicines , she have imparted her knowledge ... she only asked for a bit of solace as she conducted her research . she meant no harm .  < nl >  Enough ! Stop her lies , right this instant !  ProtagonistD said . ProtagonistD struck with ProtagonistD's staff , hitting she on the shoulder . I saw her tumble forwards , her forehead striking the ground . < nl >  To ProtagonistD ! Bring the torches ! We will burn she where she is !  < nl > Fred and Richard complied , and as they inched towards she , torches in hand , blank expressions on their faces , I waited again , hoping someone would do something , anything . < nl > I pulled on the sleeves of those around me , begging them to step forward . < nl > But they shrugged me off , transfixed . No one was going to listen to a boy who was still too young to shave . More importantly , no one was going to listen to their hearts , their consciences . < nl > I heard she cry out , though from pain or fear I was not sure . The torch was inches away , but she could not twist free , as tight as her bonds were . < nl > I grit my teeth , then did a quick headcount . Two dozen , maybe more . There were children too , and if I had more time I would have thought twice about whether they were as sturdy as the adults , whether they could recover as quickly . < nl > But I was out of time , and so I stepped forward , clenched my eyes , focused on a single word , and poured every shred of energy I had into it . I had never exerted myself so much before . < nl > * SLEEP * < nl > I knew it had worked when I heard the steady thuds of comatose bodies hitting the floor . I opened my eyes , and I saw that some of her other possessions on the ground had lighted up , flashing an incandescent array of colours . I pushed past the crowd , pulled she up , shifted her weight onto me . she struggled to keep her eyes open . < nl >  she ... she was right ...  she said , smiling .  It ... it is real ...  < nl >  Later ,  I said .  We have to go , now . There 's a lot we have to talk about .  < nl > To better cope with her weight , I borrowed ProtagonistD's staff . From the way ProtagonistD was sleeping peacefully on the ground , it did n't seem like ProtagonistD needed it . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos >  I do n't know if Alice 's all that daft . I think she may be a witch .  < nl >  Who ? she A witch ? I doubt that very much .  < nl >  she could be playing dumb to throw us off , so we do n't suspect .  < nl >  We are talking about she . she , right ?  < nl >  she does have the best vegetables in the county . Could be she needs it for her gardening spells .  < nl >  she ?  < nl >  We were the only village that did n't get the plague . Sounds like a sacrifice to me . And , I 'm pretty sure she cursed Carol .  < nl >  Cursed she ?  < nl >  Yeah , my mum says that years ago she and she got in an argument 'cause her kid 's humours were all out of < nl > balance and she wanted to bleed the tyke . The kid died . Ever since then , she loses more patients than she saves .  < nl >  Well , you 've convinced me . I guess we 've got to burn she , then ?  < nl >  I do n't see anything else we can do . Ca n't have a witch in the village .  < nl > edit : formatting . < eos > 
< sos > Alice pushed a lock of hair from her eyes as she leaned sheepishly against the doorway and looked lovingly at the back of Carol's head . she , in turn , was looking at the television . < nl > It was one in the morning on a Wednesday , and they were in a swanky hotel suite . In another context , this could almost have been romantic , she thought . < nl > she shuffled aside as a face with a lanyard ID pushed past she into the room , joining the throng . There were at least two dozen people in there , but she felt there was a special glow around she , the lighting seemed to pick she out , draw the eye . Or maybe it was just her imagination . < nl > she was minutes away from being elected the President of the United States . < nl > Downstairs , there was a ballroom full of waiting devotees , balloons poised to drop . They were in Denver , Colorado . < nl > she was trying not to pay attention to the results , but it was impossible not to hear certain things . < nl >  she , our numbers are the same as the network 's ,  an aide was saying to she , though his eyes never left the screen .  Colorado is much closer than we thought .  < nl > Their home state . It was supposed to secure their Electoral College strategy , but it was failing them . Without it , her campaign was over . < nl > she felt her heart racing . How could this have happened ? All the east coast states had gone the way they 'd predicted . Something sickly was congealing in her stomach , a strange and irrational certainty that this was her fault . she knew she had done everything in her power to help the campaign , but still ... a memory kept playing in her mind . < nl > It was the night before . she had just spoken at a rally in Boulder - the last of the campaign . And then she had gone for dinner with Elva . Jason . she had know she since high school , and she had reached out . she had always been a strange one ; she still could not say what it was that had compelled she to accept her invitation that evening . < nl >  she look tired , she ,  she had said , over appetizers .  This last year must have been hard on she .  < nl > she thought over the endless busses and planes , the incessant press scrutiny of every aspect of their lives , the total lack of intimacy . < nl >  It 's been a trip , that 's for sure !  she said , attempting a good - natured chuckle . she stared at she . < nl >  she like to help people , she , she know that . she want to know what she can do for she .  < nl >  Oh , well at this point there 's not much-  < nl >  she do n't mean on the campaign . she mean , personally : what do she need ? After it 's all over tomorrow night , what do she want from life ?  < nl > she was looking at she strangely . Sincerity , she thought . she was thick with it . she was more sincere than anyone she had ever met . < nl >  Uh , that 's kind of she , she ,  she said . she realised her lip was quivering . < nl >  she ,  she said , leaning forward . Eyes so full of pity .  Are she happy ?  < nl > she could n't stop it . Tears rolled down her cheeks . she tried to dab them away , but it was hopeless . she forced she to breathe deeply . < nl >  she have n't been happy since she won the race for governor ,  she said , when she had regained control .  she hate it , that 's the truth . she hate politics . she wish with all her heart she had stayed in law .  she inhaled again and tried to smile .  she have n't told anyone that . Gosh . she ca n't repeat it , please promise .  < nl > she leaned back , still full of sympathy .  she promise , and she understand . It must be unimaginably hard for she .  < nl > she smiled again . she was looking at the ceiling - now it was she who was taking a deep breath . she looked back at she . < nl >  OK ,  she said ,  she can help she . she can make it alright . she have ... some favours she can call in .  < nl >  What are she talking about ?  she said . she was standing up , paying the bill . she felt horrendously flustered . < nl >  she 'm talking about helping she , she . Do n't worry about a thing .  < nl > she turned back to look at she from the door .  Remember ,  she laughed ,  she owe she !  < nl > That was last night . Now she was was in a room that had just gone very quiet . A news anchor , full of his own importance , had just called Colorado for the opposition . < nl >  It 's a shock result , let me tell you ,  a pundit was saying .  We 're seeing a polling failure like nowhere else in the country . The state was always going to be close but there seems to have been a last minute swing of about 10,000 votes , mainly in the Boulder area , that handed it to she .  < eos > 
< sos > The line behind Alice was growing as she sifted through pages of words on a computerized booth . Each word was followed by a price tag that reflected its complexity . < nl >  Hurry . You , hurry , please ,  demanded a man in a custodian gear that stood behind she .  Go . Go .  The numerous people in the queue all seemed to nod in agreement . < nl > she had no words to reassure them that she was moving as fast as she could , so she remained silent and focused . < nl > The Department of Speech Permission , or DSP , was the government office in charge of selling word licenses to the public . For a citizen to be able to speak or write a word , the citizen must first purchase the right to use that word from this office . The DSP also had the power to set the prices . Depending on simplicity , utility or other unnamed factors , a word 's price could be relatively inexpensive . Other words could be so expensive that people often choose to buy a limited number of uses . < nl > Carol yelled out ,  Come on ! We all have things to do .  < nl > she could n't help but notice how flippantly she used so many wide - utility words . she must have bought them all for unlimited use . Despite that , however , she knew that she was poor as well . If she were actually wealthy , she would be in the Expedited Service Section of the DSP . < nl > she was right , of course . she was one of the many working class that bought into the notion that you have to fake it to make it . she had spent all her savings and put she into debt in order to keep conversation with upper management .  Just pick one ! she have to get to work !  she had gotten so good at bluffing her vocabulary that people rarely notice she only used one - syllable words . Unfortunately , she was unaware her bosses had noticed and mocked she behind closed doors . < nl > she motioned to she as well . she had no words for she either . < nl > But not for long . she finally found the word for which she had been saving on her lowly salary . A bright warning prompt flashed on screen .  Unlimited ?  it asked . Yes .  Are you sure ?  it warned one last time . Yes . < nl > she basked at her profile on the computer screen . It now read : < nl > > * * she * * < nl > Sex : Male < nl > Age : 36 < nl > Total Vocabulary : 1 < nl > Accessible Words :  Revolution  ( unlimited ) < eos > 
< sos > I almost did n't recognize Alice when she walked in . Age will do that to a person . I 've said for years that men stop aging at twenty - five and do n't change one bit except for weight until they reach almost fifty . Women however evolve . It 's impossible to guess how old Carol is . Only if she is younger or older than you . < nl > That was the problem I had with she . The first time I met she , she was older than me by at least twenty years . That was two decades ago , almost to the day . Today ... she was younger . Hell , I do n't think she was allowed in normal bars . Not that I ever carded anyone . If you could find The Happy Hour , I 'd serve you . < nl > she came up to the bar and asked if the manager was about .   I blinked twice before telling she no . Then she asked about the owner . It took me a second to realize , she had n't been here yet . < nl > Fucking timeloops . < nl > I told she the owner was n't in , but I could probably help . she sighed and said she was looking for a job . she was stranded and needed to get back on her feet . < nl > I asked if she had any skills . she looked embarrassed , then shook her head . I almost said something , then tossed she an apron . Told she to clean up tables . Do a good job and she could come back tomorrow . < nl > she did and she did . About three weeks in , I started training she as a waitress , and within a year she could cover bar . It took a while , but I got she to the point where I could take days off and the place would n't burn down . < nl > Then one day I left my resignation on the counter with a note . < nl >  On a Friday , at 3:14am you will find Elva unconscious in the storeroom . Do not call the cops . she 's going to get you back on your feet . Might take a while .  < nl > Edit : < nl > Since people have asked < nl > Persona Non Grata ( ships of valor book 1 ) < nl > Aaron Kennedy < nl > Available on amazon ( preview enabled ) and amazon unlimited ( free to read for members ) < nl > Thank you all for the kind words and support ! < nl > Edit 2 - Added  The Flipside  which is the  Owners  side of the story < eos > 
< sos > The Hall of Heroes was one of the few types of places where images of people were permitted to be displayed . < nl > The  Hall  were composed of several dozen corridors not unlike this one : as wide as a street and long as a block , lined with terrifyingly accurate icons , some no larger than my palm but some bigger than my outstretched arms . < nl > I asked Alice why only some were in color . < nl > she explained that the grey icons represented those who had passed on , whose destinies were complete and thus their place in the Hall solidified . < nl > But the fate of those in color had yet to pass , so they were subject to move to more or less favorable positions and their portraits could even change size . A directory was needed to find them . < nl > she dialed a few keys on the directory and brought us to Carol . < nl > she was beyond the realm of man , she said , moving so far and so fast that fate could not keep up with she , and thus she had hardly experienced more years than she had , even though she first ventured towards the stars over a hundred years ago . < nl > her icon was far from the most impressive . But she asked me to pray with she anyways , before an icon of Elva . Not just for her sake , but for the sake of us all . Fate guide she to our salvation . < eos > 
< sos > Alice had an intimate knowledge of healing the human body . By day , she was a nurse at the local hospital , and her hours were filled with checking in on patients , changing gauzes and bedpans , listening to grouses and complaints , and generally trying to keep as many people alive as possible . More experienced than most doctors , she was the name most frequently buzzed on the intercom when an emergency beckoned . < nl > Which was why she was slightly ticked off when Carol steadfastly refused her offers of first aid . < nl >  What do she mean , she 're fine ?  asked she , adopting the same tone she used for small children and obstinate adults .  Look at the wound ! It 's bleeding out onto the carpet , for goodness sakes ! Whoever told she that tissue paper was a good way to staunch bloodflow ?  < nl >  It 's just a small cut ,  said she , turning her body away from she . Fresh spots of blood were already blooming through the thick wad of Kleenex she had slapped onto her arm , threatening to trickle down and ruin the floorboards . < nl > she clucked her tongue , then pressed forward , ignoring the grumpy protests . Just before she touched her skin , she channelled the faintest amount of energy into her fingertips . she wanted to calm she down , aid the healing process , but she did n't want the effect to be so pronounced that it would give away the fact that she was Talented . < nl > It worked , after a fashion . she stopped struggling , then moodily looked on as she finished the dressing . < nl >  Work accident ?  she asked . < nl >  Yea , kind of ,  she said .  Thanks , she guess . But there was no need to , she would have healed , really .  < nl >  That 's what they all say ,  said she .  If she ask she how she got it , would she tell she ? she need to know so that she can get she the right medication .  < nl > The injury was a serious one , not life - threatening , but certainly grave enough to warrant stitches . she was tempted to simply close the wound she , bind it together with magical fibres , shorten what would have taken nature a couple of weeks to perhaps a few seconds , tops . That was out of the question , of course , as long as she did n't have her mask on . < nl >  It looks like she got cut by a heated blade , or something like that ,  said she . her mind had already discarded the only other possibility , which was contact with an energy pulse , which was impossible given that she was still here , alive .  Is her workplace unsafe ? You can report such things , you know .  < nl > she barked out a short laugh .  Hah ,  she said ,  more dangerous than she can imagine . But someone 's got ta do what she do , and there 's no use complainin ' . Are she done fussin ' ? she 've only got a couple of hours before she head out , and she would rather just rest in peace .  < nl > A scowl crossed her face .  she know she should mind her own business , but she ... she 've got to have healthier habits , she know . her late nights , her frequent injuries , she keeping to she in her dark room all the time ... the rest of the roommates are fine with she wanting to be left alone , but do try and reach out to others a bit more . It 'll do she a world of good to -  < nl > The speed at which she lunged forward caught she by surprise , and if she had a hair 's less control over her reflexes , she would have thrown up an energy shield , fried she on the spot . Instead , she merely bumped past she , rocking she back , as she leapt towards the television , turning up the volume . < nl >  It 's them ,  she said ,  they 're at it again .  < nl > she recognised the scene immediately . Jameson Park , where the anti - government protestors had gathered again , despite all warnings by the government to disperse . The anti - riot police were out in force too , forming a single barricade between the protestors and City Hall . Behind the anti - riot police were huge , ominous shapes , each gleaming in the sun - the Rampagers , metallic monstrosities created by the Tinkerer from the League of Heroes , meant to help maintain law and order in the city . < nl >  she thought Elva said she would negotiate peacefully with them ?  she asked . Had she missed some development in the news ? Had she been so caught up with work again that she failed to keep up with what was happening ? < nl >  The bastards ,  said she , face scrunched in anger .  she told them , not this way , do it another way , but noooo , they would n't listen ...  < nl > The camera zoomed in on a protestor hurling a water bottle at the police barricade . It struck ProtagonistD awkwardly on the head , and although ProtagonistD's helmet was reinforced , ProtagonistD fell like a rock . Even before ProtagonistD's body hit the ground , ProtagonistD's fellow officers had already surged forward , stun batons in hand , striking in retaliation . < nl > That single incident , that flame to open gasoline , sparked a convulsive tremor through the crowd . she watched , horrified , as the two masses crashed together . The darkened eyes of the Rampagers lit up ominously . < nl >  Is it so hard to just listen to the citizens , give them what they want ?  asked she , her voice dropping to a whisper . < nl >  Fools ,  said she .  The government does care , but no one gives them a chance . You toil all day to make their lives better , but the moment something goes wrong , the moment a single oversight occurs , they overreact like we 're oppressing them .  < nl >  It 's just ...  said she , reaching for the right words .  It 's just that sometimes the government does seem ... heavy - handed , you know ? Like they only care about the big picture , but they forget that society 's made up of all these small , individual , yet still important , parts ...  < nl > she slammed the television with her hand , knocking off the snowglobe they kept on top of it . The snowglobe shattered on the ground , spilling its flakes across the floor .  The individual is selfish , she . Remember that . The government knows best , and it is better that way , trust she . she 've seen worse .  < nl > The violence on the screen escalated , as could be seen by the fiery Molotov cocktails being lobbed by the crowd , and the mind - control beams being engaged by the Rampagers . An emergency broadcast message flashed across the screen , notifying all civilians to stay away from Jameson Park , and also listing a string of numbers to call for help . < nl > Then , a laser beam shot out of the crowd , either from an unregistered Talented or a smuggled energy cannon . The beam coursed right through one of the Rampagers , sundering its protective armor , spilling its electrical guts out . It convulsed , then froze , then crashed to the ground . The protestors , galvanized by this momentary victory , cheered , then redoubled their efforts to raze City Hall to the ground . < nl > At that moment , a single silver symbol appeared at the bottom of the screen . < nl > The emblem of the League of Heroes , a call for the Talented to gather , to lend their strength to the government . < nl > she heard her watch buzz , and she quickly covered it with her good hand .  she 've ... got to go ,  she said , as she turned his watch away from her eyes .  her ... boss is calling . Got a last - minute request to ... fix one of the machines at work , it seems .  < nl > she sighed , then went in search of the dustpan . Someone could get hurt , stepping on the shards of the ruined snowglobe .  Just do n't overuse that arm , she ,  she said .  The wound will open again , and she 'll have more trouble then .  < nl > she waited until she disappeared into her room again , and ignored she as she emerged with a heavy box . she occupied she with cleaning up the mess as she rushed out the door , muttering curses along the way . < nl > When she was sure she had gone , that no one could hear she , she stalked back to her room , threw open her wardrobe , keyed in the secret combination , and grimaced as hidden panels unfolded to reveal her disguise . < nl > This was a far cry from when she had an entire lair under the city lake , but this would have to do . < nl > her heart ached as the sounds of the newscast drifted in from the living room . she reckoned that by the time she got there , the Rampagers would have already stilled over a hundred people , and that was n't even counting the hundreds more beaten into submission by the police , the very people sworn to protect and serve the public . < nl >  War never ends , does it ,  said Rachel , otherwise known as the Witch Doctor , bounty of $ 25 million , third in command of the Insufferables , the underground resistance made up of all Talented deemed unaligned with the interests of the government . < nl > she opened a portal , grit her teeth , then stepped through it . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos > Alice stood dumbstruck by the sight in her front yard . A small black horse stood neighing and stamping it 's hooves in the melting snow . When she say horse , it had blue flame in place of a mane and tail and as it stamped small flares leapt from it 's hooves . < nl >  she , why is ProtagonistE on fire ?  Carol's voice broke her frozen mind . < nl >  Umm , she , as much as she would love to give she an explanation on what a nightmare is right now , she am a little held up on the fact that she could have asked for one apparently years ago and she would have gotten one so please give she a moment to collect she .  she stared down at the letter that was left taped to the door specifically the sender line : Elva .  Uhh , she can she tell she how to spell ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  S ?  < nl >  Yep .  < nl >  A , t ?  she shook her head slightly . < nl >  A , n ?  she finished and looked at she quizically . < nl > she shook her head again .  Sorry she , that 's , that 's not right .  < nl >  But that 's what the letter says .  she pouted . < nl >  she know she , but that 's how she spell she .  < nl >  Ohhh .  she giggled .  S , a , n , t , a.  she said proudly . < nl >  Very good . When she sent her letter to ProtagonistD , did she check her spelling ? Or were she too excited and just sent it ?  < nl >  she 'm sorry she .  she pouted looking down . < nl >  No , no it 's not her fault . Okay let 's , well actually she stay , she 'll approach ProtagonistE .  she stepped off the the porch and cautiously moved closer to the flaming horse . It turned to stare at she , small flames jetted from it 's nostrils as it exhaled harshly .  Hey there , little , guy .  she reached out a hand to which it whinnied at shaking its head and backing up . < nl >  Holy-  ProtagonistF had apparently come to check on us .  Umm , she ? What the hell is that ?  < nl >  It 's ProtagonistE !  she answered cheerfully .  It 's from , from ... she ! she 's what she said her name was .  < nl > ProtagonistF glared at she .  she  < nl >  No what she said , alright , the letter says it 's from she . she told she to write a letter to ProtagonistD for ProtagonistE .  she tried to explain .  Well at least , * ProtagonistD * delivers .  she half mumbled . ProtagonistF shot she another glare . < nl >  I love she !  she declared loudly . she looked at she and then back to ProtagonistF before bursting into laughter . ProtagonistF attempted to maintain ProtagonistF's glare but soon failed joining she in a laugh . As she attempted to regain her composure she felt a sudden heat on her back and a blue fireball shot past her shoulder . she fell to the ground and crawled backward putting distance again between she and the nightmare , she giggled at she . < nl >  Hey what 's this package ?  ProtagonistF asked . ProtagonistF tore open the sides and removed the contents . There was a black leather - like lead and a note : < nl > * she , * < nl > * she thank she for the letter , it is rare for she to receive one of its kind . she hope her gift to she is an acceptable one , she agree with she that everyone should have fun in their life , that a fantasy is something to hope for . she do hope she enjoy this element of fantasy she have granted she . Inside is a lead suitable for ponies of his kind , she believe she is capable of explaining to she enough about a nightmare for she to properly care for ProtagonistE . * < nl > * With regards , her friend , * < nl > * Satan * < nl > * P.S. she loves apples . * < nl > ProtagonistF read the letter outloud and looked up at she , she could tell ProtagonistF was as lost as she was .  Umm , ProtagonistF , how about we try and take ProtagonistE to the back so ProtagonistE does n't surprise anyone else .  < nl >  Ok .  ProtagonistF skipped down the porch and to ProtagonistE .  C'm on Blue .  ProtagonistF waved ProtagonistF's hand to ProtagonistE motioning to ProtagonistE to follow . ProtagonistE stood still staring with ProtagonistE's deep red eyes at ProtagonistF . < nl >  Oh !  ProtagonistF called out .  she sent an apple along .  ProtagonistF looked genuinely approving . ProtagonistF tossed the apple to she and she stood up waving the apple in ProtagonistE's face . ProtagonistE began to neigh and quickly followed . < nl >  Wait !  she yelled .  she wanna do it .  she whined . she handed she the apple and she called to it making a snapping sound with her tongue . she took it through the gate and into the backyard . < nl > ProtagonistF hurried down the steps .  What the hell are we supposed to do with that ?  < nl >  How should she know , she do n't exactly think it comes with a return to sender address .  she replied . < nl >  Well anything else this Christmas she asked she to make real from her books ?  ProtagonistF mocked . < nl >  Hey , she did n't ask for that , she asked for a pony , she said write a letter to ProtagonistD .  < nl >  Well how the hell did she know that quote from her book ?  < nl >  she do n't know , maybe she 's a fan .  < nl >  Nice explanation , hey now it 's her turn she 'm gon na go write a letter to ProtagonistD .  she gestured quotations in the air , mocking she .  she want magic like Cassie 's .  < nl >  Nice choice , she love ProtagonistF .  she laughed .  Real quick though can we talk about the fact that we 're openly discussing she like it 's normal accepted conversation ?  < nl >  No .  ProtagonistF replied simply .  We 've got a flaming horse in our backyard .  ProtagonistF smiled and pointed over to the gate where she was leading ProtagonistE * in circles . < nl >  Have she mentioned she * really * love she .  < nl >  she better . We can worry more about if she is real later , for now let 's worry about she .  < nl >  she !  she screamed .  ProtagonistG sneezed and the bush is on fire !  < nl > she headed through the gate over to the small flame slowly heading down the branch .  Yeah , * she 're * gon na need to teach ProtagonistG to * not * do that .  < nl > _ < nl > [ R / TheoreticalFictions](https://www.reddit.com / r / TheoreticalFictions ) < eos > 
< sos >  Carol do n't understand !  Alice laughed . she , danced through the streets .  she 'm the richest person alive .  she said with a smile . < nl > she looked down at she . she liked to walk through these parts of the city to remind she . she grew up not more than a few blocks south . < nl > she thought it strange that she had began speaking to she ; out of the blue telling she how she did n't understand . Stranger still that she had responded quite reasonable , as if they had been having a perfectly sensible conversation all taking place inside her own mind . < nl >  How do she know she do n't understand ?  she said as she skipped around she in circles . < nl >  Well , do * she * understand ?  < nl >  Understand what ?  < nl >  Exactly !  she said with a shriek . < nl > she had a feeling of familiarity with she , as if she knew she from a very long time ago . < nl >  Have we met before ? You and she ?  she said with a hint of anxiety . < nl >  she 've known she for a very long time ago .  < nl > As she said this she felt her stomach drop . ' Can she * hear * she ? ' < nl >  No no , of course she ca n't * hear * she .  < nl > As she said this she stopped circling she . she stood directly in front of she and gazed up with a stare that seemed to look through she . < nl >  she can hear she but not with these ears . she can see she but not with these eyes . Though she she have a hand in everything and without any desire she control all that she know . she have nothing and so everything is mine . Do she know who she am ?  < nl > she heard she speak ,  No , but she feel like she remember she . From a time she ca n't place and a place she ca n't remember . What is her name she ?  < nl >  she 'm not little and she 'm not one , two , or none . Of the light and the darkness she 'm the space which holds both . Of remembering and forgetting , she 'm the one who knows both . she am pure consciousness . she have nothing and so she 'm the richest person alive . she want nothing so she am given all that this world possesses . she was never created so she ca n't die . she am fearless ever lasting peace .  < nl >  Now tell she she , just who are she ?  < eos > 
< sos > Three things contributed to Alice dancing down the cobbled street , through the peppery rain and silver September evening , telling all who cared to listen that she was rich ; the tumour was only one of those things , and it was the one she did not know about . Of course , she felt the headaches -- how could she not ? The migraines had only tiptoed in their monthly rehearsals the previous year , but now they stomped almost weekly , thundering forward toward their finale . Their curtain call . * Lonesome pains * , the orphanage owner had told she . No need for a doctor to get involved .   They 'd go away when she finally found a family . When a family found she . < nl > Today was that day -- and it was the second reason for she dancing down that weathered street under the paper clouds and candle sun . she 'd been * found . * And the finders could n't have been more perfect . The lady had huge , kind eyes . Not beady or grey , like of those who ran the orphanage -- but fading autumn green ; welcoming , like the wavy shore of the sea calling she to come dip her feet . Not that she had seen the sea . Oh and Carol ! she had smiled at she . No man had ever smiled at she like that . Like they 'd meant it . The scars she felt inside of she -- that she 'd always felt inside of she , had been suddenly coated by something sweet . Treacle , she pondered . At the very least , by something hopeful . < nl > They could have had any of the children . But they 'd chosen she . she < nl > There were papers to sign and dots to dot , crosses to cross . But they said they would be back tomorrow , and then she would be leaving with them . she could hardly stop her feet from fidgeting upon hearing those words , but she showed restraint for a little longer -- that 's what people looked for in a child : restraint -- and she waited until they had left before moving . she scrambled to the front door after they closed it , and pressed her ear firm against the oak , waiting for the rumble of the automobile to die away as the evening wind . Then , she snuck out . < nl > she had n't gone very far at all when she 'd found the silver coin on the side of the pavement , a glimmer of light beneath a crumbling leaf . The third and final reason . A sign from God of how her life was changing -- she would tell all who would listen of her good fortune . And so she danced through the peppery rain , through the satin September evening -- until the lonesome headache began , for the final time . she stumbled on the pavement , and almost fell . Why ,   she wondered , as the dancers in her head began to stomp , why was it hurting still ? Perhaps it would n't stop until she was living with her finders . she bit down on her tongue for distraction -- nothing would ruin she perfect today . she continued down the street , not noticing how cold her feet were against the cobblestone , or how numb and disobedient her limbs had become .   she chose not to see the black dots that clouded her precious evening . < nl > The curtain call arrived with a cacophony of applause . A rapturous rupture . The red of a liquid rose trickled from her nose . < nl > she fell onto the street , her head bouncing like a rubber ball with a hiss of air as it slowly deflated . The coin escaped her hand as her fingers peeled open , and rolled behind she , back toward the orphanage . < nl > People crowded about she as the blood pooled . Virgin red dying dirty grey . < nl > * Are she okay , she ? * came a man 's voice . < nl > * Get a doctor , * said another . * she , * cooed a woman . < nl > Poor ? Could n't they see ? < nl > * she 'm not poor , * she tried to explain , * not any longer * -- but her lips only managed a crooked smile . < nl > --- < nl > Thank you for reading .

< sos >  You bitch !  A voice roared from upstairs , followed shortly by a loud crash .   I rolled my eyes and heaved myself to my feet .   Here we go again . < nl >  What 's wrong ?  I called wearily , making my way towards the stairs .   Alice was nonchalantly coming down , Bible in hand .   For being the incarnation of Death , she always seemed to be reading her Bible ( which she had stolen from a motel room when I was n't looking .   Ironic , right ? ) . < nl >  What 're they fighting about ?  I asked she as she rounded the bannister and headed toward the kitchen . < nl >  Limos stole Elva or something stupid like that .  she whispered , not even looking up from her book .   I sighed and rubbed the bridge of my nose as ProtagonistD came tumbling down the stairs as well . < nl >  Carol 's about to lose it !  she gasped , running for cover .   Just then , a lamp flew across the hallway and smashed straight through the wall . < nl >  her anger issues are why she left she !  Limos screamed , appearing from her room , followed < nl > promptly by her flying dresser . < nl >  And she thought the best way to get around her anger was to cheat on she ? !  < nl > Oh boy .   she 'm going to have to take a third mortgage . < nl >  Girls !   Come on , calm down !  I called up to them . < nl >  she is the one who needs to calm down !  Limos yelled back . < nl >  You want to reenact Troy ?  she continued ranting as she too appeared . < nl >  Please , she ca n't afford to rebuild the house again !  < nl > Suddenly , she seemed to gag and doubled over , dry - heaving .   she growled audibly and waved her hand , prompting a curt scream to come from the kitchen , followed by the smoke alarm going off and ProtagonistD appearing , the tips of ProtagonistD's hair on fire . < nl >  Do n't make she sick !  she yelled , charging down the stairs after ProtagonistD . < nl >  Why are you all against she ? !  she continued ,  Who else wants to take a shot at she ?  her voice broke at the last and I could see some wetness in her eyes .   Registering what she said , I pointed at she as she came out of the kitchen too ,  she stay out of this !  I ordered .   The last thing we needed was somebody 's heart stopping .   she just shrugged , coolly .   Ever calm . < nl >  Can you guys just work this out without destroying the neighborhood ?  I pleaded . < nl >  Oh , I 'll work it out .   I 'll work it out at her funeral !  she lunged at Limos again , who did her best to evade -- by using ProtagonistD as a human shield . < nl >  This is hardly a fair fight !  she cried , looking for options ,  she ?   Help ?  < nl >  No !   Do n't kill she !  < nl >  Just for a second !   We 'll bring she back !  Limos kept pleading . < nl > she waved her hand and the couch behind Limos burst into flames , catching Limos 's pants on fire in the process .   I was starting to get annoyed about this all , too .   As Limos started screaming and swatting at the flames , it seemed like all the darkness in the room congealed around the flames and snuffed them out .   she   Putting out the fire seemed to only enrage she even more , though and she started screaming again as she drew on her power .   she was about to explode , and I really ca n't afford to rebuild the house again . < nl >  she ,  I sighed ,  Just do it .  I looked over to see the slightest grin on her usually placid face as she waved a hand and all three of her sisters collapsed to the floor . < nl >  Bring them back in two minutes .  I ordered , trudging back over to the couch .   Out of all four of them , I 'm really glad Death is the obedient one . < eos > 
< sos >  Are Alice sure she want all four of them ?  Carol asked , trying unsuccessfully to keep a smile from slipping onto her face . < nl > she nodded as she read the document again .  Why not ? she said they 're inseparable .  < nl >  They might be a bit much to ... handle . she mean , four kids , and these four in particular ...  < nl >  Yeah , well , she 've never seen she in a temper ,  she said , and reached for a pen that she hurried to hand she . < nl >  Sure , she do n't mean anything against she , but these four can be strange . Sometimes .  < nl > she frowned at she .  What 's the matter ? she seemed practically relieved when she agreed to adopt them . Now she 're having second thoughts ?  < nl >  No , no ... she 'm sure she 'll cope just fine .  she smiled , overly sweet , and pointed at the next stack of forms awaiting she .  Well , let 's just get these out of the way real quick , shall we ?  < nl > * * * < nl >  Well , we 're here .  she turned into our driveway , and the girls , who 'd been talking softly among themselves in the back of the van , fell quiet . < nl >  Wow ,  Elva said , brushing her hair out of her face .  It 's ... that 's a big house .  < nl >  What , did you think she was kidding when she said you 'll each have a bedroom to yourselves ?  she said , putting the car into park . < nl > Three answered in the negative , but ProtagonistD only glowered at them . That look lent an illusion of ProtagonistD's close - cropped auburn hair being ablaze .  Oh come on , you all thought she was bullshitting .  < nl >  Hey , she 'm right here , ProtagonistD ,  she said .  And do n't use that sort of language , please . Let 's get your bags inside .  < nl > her daughters -- God , she had to get used to saying that in her head -- refused her help with their luggage , and trooped after she in silence as we walked up the driveway . Not that they were sullen or anything ; she had the impression that they were still trying to process the Harley , the fountain , and the-- < nl >  Holy crap , is that a Ferrari ?  ProtagonistD said . < nl > she sighed , but said nothing . Then ProtagonistE tapped she on the arm ; she tried not to jump at how cold ProtagonistE's fingers felt . It was ProtagonistF .  It 's really quiet here .  < nl >  Bout thirty minutes from the nearest town ,  she replied as she unlocked the front door . < nl >  she 'd know if she had n't been sleeping on our drive here ,  ProtagonistD said in a bossy tone , but was interrupted by a bout of coughing . < nl >  Okay okay ,  she said , before ProtagonistF could retort , but ProtagonistF only drifted into the house in silence before she . The rest followed , and then she shut the door behind us . < nl >  Welcome home ,  she said . < nl >  Er ... she ? What is it she do for a living again ?  she said , staring open - mouthed at the mini - chandelier over the living room . < nl > she smiled and put her arms around them .  she run her own company . Now , let 's go get you settled .  < nl > * * * < nl > For what felt like the dozenth time in just three months , she found she walking in the hallways of Far Meadow High School again . she knew the way and the amount of time required to reach ProtagonistD's classroom so well , she had begun scheduling business calls to fill up the time . < nl > ProtagonistG met she with a look of frustrated concern .  It 's a nosebleed this time ,  ProtagonistG said , ProtagonistD standing behind ProtagonistG with a tissue to ProtagonistD's nose . < nl > she heaved a sigh .  Guess she 'll take ProtagonistD's home for the day .  < nl > As usual , ProtagonistD wore a look of guilt all the way to the car , which slowly turned into one of relief .  Math lesson is so boring ,  ProtagonistD said , crumpling the blood - stained tissue up and putting it into a pocket . < nl > she scowled .  We 've been over this . Just because ProtagonistD 've studied three lessons ahead and done all the exercises , it does n't mean ProtagonistD can skip classes . Next time ProtagonistD pull this nosebleed or stomach cramp nonsense again , she might just leave ProtagonistD there .  < nl > ProtagonistD's eyes widened in the rear view mirror .  But ProtagonistD might die ! The other kids might catch what ProtagonistD have . Remember that time ProtagonistD puked ProtagonistD's guts out ? Please do n't leave ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD do n't want to die in that dumb class !  < nl >  As the eldest , what do ProtagonistD think ProtagonistD's sisters might think if ProtagonistD get to skip classes all the time ?  < nl >  Pfah . ProtagonistD 's got ProtagonistH , no way ProtagonistD 's going home unless ProtagonistH 's not there . she 's really popular , she 's like some diet expert or something so all the cool girls want to hang out with she .  < nl > she nodded absently , thinking about the board meeting she would have to miss this afternoon . < nl >  --and ProtagonistF's 's a weirdo in school , you know . ProtagonistF keeps dead spiders inside a box and shows them to everyone . Claims ProtagonistF killed them with ProtagonistF's thoughts .  < nl >  Is ProtagonistF being bullied for that ?  she said , an edge in her tone . < nl >  Nah , ProtagonistD think most people are scared of ProtagonistF or something .  ProtagonistD had whipped ProtagonistD's smartphone out .  Do n't think they even know why . ProtagonistD told some of ProtagonistD's friends about the time ProtagonistF got lost in the woods for half a day--  < nl >  Not a funny story to share ,  she said through gritted teeth . < nl >  --or the time ProtagonistF hid a dead rabbit inside ProtagonistD's closet--  < nl >  Still not funny .  < nl >  --what a mess , all that screaming and stuff being thrown about , you 'd think--  < nl >  she think she 'll take ProtagonistD to a doctor ,  she said . < nl > Not a peep was heard from ProtagonistD the rest of the way home . < nl > * * * < nl >  What now ?  she said , marching into ProtagonistK's office . ProtagonistF was there , sitting in a corner staring off into nothing . < nl >  ProtagonistI , has been telling ProtagonistJ all morning , that ProtagonistJ was going to die before the day 's end .  ProtagonistK had ProtagonistK's burly arms crossed as ProtagonistK glared at ProtagonistI .  ProtagonistK do not tolerate ProtagonistK's students threatening one another in ProtagonistK's school !  < nl >  It 's not a threat , ProtagonistI 's just a bit distracted at times ,  she said hurriedly , going to ProtagonistI and hugging ProtagonistI .  ProtagonistI's filter just goes offline , you know .  < nl >  Well , ProtagonistJ is having a nervous breakdown right now in the med room , and ProtagonistK do n't need ProtagonistJ to see ProtagonistI anymore today . Take ProtagonistI's home , please .  < nl >  ProtagonistI , what 's gotten into ProtagonistI ?  she said as she escorted ProtagonistI out of the school .  Dead animals is one thing , but you ca n't say such things to your friends !  < nl >  ProtagonistJ 's not really a friend ,  ProtagonistI said cheerfully .  Anyway , ProtagonistI was just messing with ProtagonistJ . ProtagonistJ took ProtagonistI's box away and hid it , ProtagonistI was in such a fright . Do n't worry , she . ProtagonistJ 'll die three years from today .  < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistL , shook ProtagonistL's head at she when she showed up outside the school gates . < nl >  This is beyond ProtagonistL ,  ProtagonistL said .  The police will be here soon .  < nl > A full blown riot was taking place in the school yard ; children armed with chairs and textbooks going at each other with fury . There was no order to it , no sides as far as she could tell . < nl > Only two people were n't fighting ; ProtagonistI and ProtagonistD , sitting on a bench . ProtagonistI was giggling and pointing at nobody in particular , while ProtagonistD had ProtagonistD's face buried in homework . < nl > she walked to them and said ,  What the hell is going on ? she got a call from ProtagonistK saying--  < nl >  she stole ProtagonistD's boyfriend , so they 're fighting ,  ProtagonistD said . < nl > her girls -- her beautiful sixteen - year - old daughters , whom she treasured more than anything in the world -- made she want to pull her hair out sometimes . < nl >  So why is the entire school fighting ?  she said . < nl >  Because ProtagonistD controls half of the school , and she the other half .  < nl >  she , do n't stop them , please ,  ProtagonistI said , ProtagonistI gaze suddenly sharpening .  ProtagonistI think someone might actually die today .  < nl >  Is that so ?  she said softly . her daughters froze , and then jammed their fingers into their ears . < nl > Then she bellowed ,  she and Amber Christian , you stop this madness at once !  < nl > Silence fell upon the entire school -- even the sirens outside felt diminished . A hundred heads turned her way , and she finally spotted the troublesome duo at the heart of it , their hands around each other 's throats . < nl >  For three years -- three damned years -- I've been putting up with your little quirks and visiting this school like she 'm enrolled here she , but you just made she miss an important flight today . she 'm going to count to three , and if you do n't come here by that time , she 'm leaving you back where she found you .  < nl > No sooner had she said it than she and ProtagonistD scurried to she , red - faced and crying . she added shock to their expressions when she slapped each of them once , before drawing them both into a hug . < nl >  Girls , she would like to think she raised you better than to fight over boys -- and start a school riot while you 're at it .  < nl > They babbled in protest , but she hushed them .  Enough . she wish this never happened , but there will be consequences for today .  < nl >  she , what will they do to us ?  ProtagonistD whispered . < nl >  she do n't know . But she promise ProtagonistD one thing--  she brushed ProtagonistD's hair and kissed her cheek .  she 'll be there with ProtagonistD .  < nl > * * * < nl > * Check out her [ sub](http://reddit.com / r / nonsenselocker ) for more stories ! * < eos > 
< sos > There 's nothing that strange about them at first ; it 's the same sad story you always hear . Abandoned by their parents , kicked around from this shelter to that one , one foster place to another . There were always problems and the girls never stayed anywhere very long . < nl > But problem children were your specialty . ( Or so you used to believe . ) You could n't always make a difference , but you tried . You tried to be there when no one else was . You tried to see the good in them when everyone else had given up . Your ex always said you had a martyr   complex and maybe they were right , and maybe that 's why you fell for them to begin with . Does n't matter . < nl > What matters are the four girls you adopted . The paperwork says they 're sisters and that 's the only way you 'd know . Alice is albino , sickly and pale . Life with she is a whirlwind of doctor 's appointments and prescription medicines , specialists and itemized lists of all the things she ca n't do . But none of it seems to help , and the only noticeable difference is your shrinking bank account . You learn to keep she away from other people pretty early on , as nearly everything she has is contagious in one way or another . < nl > You try to do for she anyway . You bring her books and movies and activities she can engage in from her bed . You get her her own computer so she can have access to the internet . You hire nurses , plan family outings around days when she 's feeling better . You research hospital locations in advance . she 's not a bad girl . Sweet , in her own way . It 's not her fault she 's sick all the time . Unfortunately , it means you are too . < nl > The second one is- well . she 's your problem child . A problem child among problem children . Wild and red - haired with a temper like a bonfire ... you ca n't control she . No one can control she . she has a way of instigating things , bringing out the worst in the people around she . But the thing that really bothers you is she always has a reason why it 's someone else 's fault . Always a litany of ways to justify her actions . It was those Other People , she tells you . Those Other People , and the things they did . she has her reasons and if you listen to she long enough , her reasons will become yours . she 'll convince you she was in the right . You stop listening to her excuses because it 's all you can do . < nl > You try to love she anyway , to show she a different way , fill up that angry heart with something better . Unfortunately , she can bring out the worst in you as well . < nl > she is dark haired and dark skinned and much too thin . The doctor says it 's anorexia . You take she to meetings , to support groups . You beg with she to eat . You try to fix her favorite foods . < nl > None of it helps . she 's too thin , bones sticking out everywhere , skin pulled tight . she 'd make a great Halloween costume you think , and then you cry as you scrape the food into the garbage where it goes to waste . Unfortunately , you 're starting to hate food too , just from the stress of it all . You dread mealtimes now . < nl > Then there 's she . she . she 's quiet like the eldest but healthy , or so you assume . she does n't break the rules like her she , or refuse to eat . she also does n't talk . Ever . The doctors say there 's no physical reason they can find , that it must be psychosomatic and given who she 's related to you think that 's a safe bet . < nl > And yet , for all of that she 's the one that unsettles you the most . The file you got said she 's the youngest but sometimes you wonder . There 's something * old * in her eyes and when you catch she staring at you it raises the hackles on the back of your neck .   she does n't appear to be interested in anything at all . Not in books or movies or games or other people . she seems politely disinterested with the world ; bored but serene .   she eats what you put in front of she and you ca n't say whether she enjoys it or not . she goes to bed at the same time every night . she obeys every rule she 's given and it freaks you out a bit , because   there 's something completely otherworldly about she , and you have no idea how to reach she . Sometimes you think she 's amused by all the little rules and silly rituals humans have , but then you catch yourself thinking that way and stop . You do n't even know where those thoughts come from . < nl > You 're under a lot of stress , is all . < nl > Then it all hits the fan the night your red - head daughter brings home a boy . < nl > ( will continue later , am tired ) < eos > 
< sos >  Look , Alice , like ... she just was n't good enough for Carol . OK ?  < nl >  Yeah , she guess ... she seemed nice though .  < nl > Nice . she comes charging into my palace dragging a terrified octogenarian in white robes clutching a wooden staff for dear life and a teenage girl with a bargain - basement spell book who looked like Elva was positively shitting she , dressed all up in holy plate armor , shouting obscenities about the  fucking filthy bastard abomination piece of shit demons  she was going to  disembowel  while her  cleric  and  white mage  tried to keep from being eaten by the palace decor and scrambled to remember the three spells they 'd memorized in the panic of it all . Super nice guy . < nl >  Your infernal highness ,  ProtagonistD said as ProtagonistD approached the throne .  ProtagonistD have a report .  < nl >  Is it about the ... um , are we calling she a paladin ? Is that what we 're doing ?  < nl >  she was wearing the regalia of the Holy Order , your great dark majesty .  < nl >  It just seems like such a loaded term . You know , we 're trying to get away from this whole us versus them rhetoric , be more tolerant , watch our microaggressions , eat fewer babies - you know , a better demon king for a better demon world .  < nl >  Yes , your magnificent wickedness , and I am honored to serve such a respectable lord of darkness , but the ... um , she and her companions , sire ...  < nl >  Right , your report .  < nl >  Should she really be present for this , sire ?  < nl >  Oh , go on , ProtagonistE ,  she said , resting her head in her right hand as she tried to get more comfortable in her seat next to the throne ,  she 've heard much worse . Trust she . her father has all of the eunuchs who attend she castrated with string and bits of glass .  Igzaril - that was ProtagonistE's name ; she 'd been calling she ' Sir Sexy Horns ' for so long in her head she 'd forgotten - shuddered at the thought and then nodded . < nl >  Entrails , sire . The hell hounds in the lobby did a spectacular job of ending her ... crusade ? Can she still say crusade ?  < nl >  Let 's go with mission to be safe .  < nl >  Well , anyway , while the hounds were happy to tear she apart ,  and that 's when she interrupted she , growing suddenly agitated by the entire situation . It had been sixteen months since the king of ... whatever the human cesspool above ground and due East of here was called had orchestrated the  kidnapping  of she in the desperately lazy attempt at finding a  worthy  and  honorable  man to marry she . And kill she . That was also big on his political agenda . Great way to score points with the Holy Order - kill Lord Zabuliz the Unkillable Evil . Ignore the  unkillable  part of her name entirely . Focus on the last word . Humans . < nl >  Just call she the ' guy , ' or something . Paladin is too political , but ' gentleman ' is giving she entirely too much credit .  < nl >  Yes , sire . Well , the guy who attacked - oh you 're right , that does feel a lot better - and his support team must have drank a rather impressive amount of holy water just before storming the palace . The hell hounds all have pretty badly singed snouts , ProtagonistE 'm afraid .  < nl >  Oh no !  she said at once , sitting up straight with her eyes open and look a genuine concern for the cute - albeit snarling , ferocious , wreathed in flame , and almost constantly dripping with the blood of the innocent - hell hounds that stood guard on the lower levels - the only levels of the palace that any of her potential suitors had ever made it to . We ran a tight ship .  Are the puppies alright ?  < nl >  They 'll be fine , she ,  ProtagonistE said , bowing to conceal an obvious smile ,  they just might be sulking for a while . If another attack comes in soon we might actually have to send in personnel to deal with the situation .  < nl >  How well staffed is the lobby ?  < nl >  Well , there 's ProtagonistF and usually four to six guards posted . We could up the number of guards if you 'd like , sire , maybe give a few of the more industrious imps something useful to do , but ProtagonistF - has been complaining that ProtagonistF 's getting a bit bored at ProtagonistF's desk and ProtagonistF 's actually an impressively skilled magician - necromancy , mostly , although ProtagonistE think ProtagonistE saw mastery of elemental conjuration and classical malediction on ProtagonistF's CV . With the caliber of magic users that have been coming through on palad ... 'good guy ' support ProtagonistE 'm confident ProtagonistF 'd be more than a match . ProtagonistF 'd probably have them eating hellfire the moment they step through the door .  < nl >  Well , that 's serendipitous to say the least . Inform ... was it Fuhlazmin ?  < nl >  ProtagonistF , your unparalleled malevolence .  < nl >  Let ProtagonistF know ProtagonistF 'll be getting a raise . I 'll think of a new title as well . All I 've got in my head right now is ' battle secretary ' and that 's hot garbage .  < nl >  There is another problem , her immortal oppressor of the light ,  ProtagonistE said , and she sunk instinctively back in her throne so far that her wings got all mashed up and her tail squished against the seat in a manner so painful that she had to instantly adjust .  The holy water that the guy and his companions drank . Their entrails splattered against the walls of the lobby . Steaming with holy magic .  < nl >  Ugh ,  she said , putting a clawed hand to her forehead . she felt a migraine coming on right behind her horns .  And no one can clean it up without getting burned , right ?  < nl >  she 'll do it ,  she said , standing up and walking towards the door without a second word . she sounded happy , perhaps excited even to have something to do besides sit around and wait to be rescued , and even looked back once   and smiled before disappearing through the gate of lost souls down the stairwell through the chamber of horrors and the tunnel of unrelenting evil that led past the cafeteria to the broom closet where she 'd presumably - hopefully - break out the purple stuff and the good mop . < nl >  she 's great ,  ProtagonistE said once she was out of the throne room .  Really . It 's been lovely having she around .  < nl >  she know . she 'd marry she she if she were n't so fucking gay .  < nl > EDIT : Wow , she did not respect this kind of response , thank you all so much ! she 'll post a Part 2 as a reply to this comment . she hope you guys enjoy it as well ! < nl > EDIT 2 : Again , WOW . she really did not expect this to blow up . For her first ( she think her first ? ) post on this sub , she was optimistically hoping for double digit upvotes at best , so THANK YOU ALL again ! she will definitely continue this story - she have absolutely no clue what her next step is going to be aside from she writing and posting it ( somewhere ? somehow ? someone help ? advice ? ) but she obviously have an audience here and she love this story so far so she will definitely give you guys more . As in hopefully tomorrow more . Thanks again ! < nl > EDIT 3 : ( Last one , really ) OK so for the time being she am going to be posting the continuation of this story directly on her profile until she find a better place to stick them , so - can she even ask people to subscribe to her profile ? Is that soliciting ? Will a Mod come strike she down ? Anyway , for now , Parts 1 and 2 ( and tomorrow , Part 3 ! ) of  The Infinite Darkness of Lord Zabuliz the Unkillable Evil ( And Friends ! )  will be posted directly on her profile , /u / bochibochi < eos > 
< sos > Carol showed up at Alice's doorstep . The doorbell pinged anxiously . < nl >  Who is it ?  she yelled . The chair she sat in sagged . Silence followed . < nl > The doorbell squawked again , against its will . she began pressing it again and again . The color seemed to disappear around she . < nl > she stood up and her chair groaned . The brown leather seemed to gray with each step she took towards the door . < nl >  What do she want ?  she asked as she grabbed the knob of the door .  she do n't have any appointments she ...  her voice caught in her throat . < nl > she wore a USA Today badge . her gray pantsuit wore her body well . she nodded courteously . < nl >  she 'm here for she . Is that she ?  her voice was clear , but the area surrounding her body seemed to dampen everything ever so slightly . < nl >  Yes ,  she replied after processing her request . Then asked,What do she want ?  < nl >  Just a second . she 'd prefer to keep her shoes on . she hope that 's alright wth she ?  she begin to walk forward . < nl > she hesitated , but she was already halfway through her door . she found she sitting back where she had been . she sat across from she . < nl > The leather chair was she now . And it definitely seemed gray . Everything seemed gray to she , right now . < nl >  she want to show she something .  she took her phone out of her pocket .  We started a report a few weeks ago .  < nl > she continued to talk , but the noise became less and less distinguishable . she heard something about 1000 people , and maybe Elva's name . The grayness around she grew louder and she found her gaze drifting . < nl >  Hello ?  she snapped her fingers in front of her eyes . she barely moved . < nl > How is this possible , she thought . The stories thy had all heard about she . she . Right in front of she . They could n't have been lying . They had done everything randomly . It was impossible . < nl >  she changed her life ,  most had said . < nl >  I would n't be here if it were n't for she ,  said others . < nl > A thousand thoughts flashed before her eyes , and she buried her doubt . she would report her story and be done with it . she had known something was up . At least she 'd be able to move on from this ridiculousness that had started everyone in the office to sharing stories about being saved . < nl >  she am who she am now , because of she .  < nl > she sat in front of she . Looking dull . Everything was gray . < nl > her lungs filled with all the everything , and she held it for just a second . < nl > she tilted her head . Shifting her brows . < nl > As she exhaled , all of the color came back . she had n't noticed . she had never noticed . Everything was so vibrant . < nl > A tear rolled down her cheek . < nl > They had all been right . < eos > 
< sos > Sitting alone in Alice's room , she closed her eyes , wishing whoever had just rang the doorbell would just leave . she was n't feeling up to dealing with people today . she had seen Elva . There was just one problem with that . < nl > she see dead people . < nl > Well , * almost * dead people , to be accurate . It 's her own morbid miracle , a gift or a curse depending on the day . < nl > It started when she was small , venturing out of the house with Carol . she would point and scream happily , begging she to look . It 's another person ! At first she ignored it . In later years she wrote it off as imagination . Not long after that she had learned not to bring it up . For she , seeing a stranger on the street was exciting . For she , it was cruel . she knew she could n't see anything in the darkness , and she claiming she could see people seemed like a cry of desperation ; she wished she could see people , so she convinced she that she did . she had never discovered the mystery of why she can see certain strangers , but it had become her normal . < nl > Until last year . her family had gone to see she in the hospital , unsure how long she had left on this earth . she had only been in a hospital once before at a young age , but when she told she they were filled with lots of people she assumed that 's why she could see more of them . she saw she that day , for the first time in her life . her thin , silvery hair was short and surprisingly well maintained for someone who had been in that bed for weeks . she looked fragile , her arms far from the strong , energetic ones that had rescued she from mishaps in her youth . she had no idea why she could see she , but it was her miracle . Until , soon after returning home that night , we got the call that she had passed away . That 's when she began to put it together . Months later her theory was confirmed when she witnessed a car accident . Or rather , witnessed the life leaving the accident . The sound of crunching metal to her right while riding in the car caused she to whip her head to the source of the sound . ProtagonistD entered her darkness , bloody and barely leaving . Moments later , ProtagonistD stopped breathing and faded from her view . < nl > Sighing , she stood and walked toward her door . she could hear voices downstairs , sure that ProtagonistD had decided to stay . Today was not the day to be reprimanded for rudeness , so she made her way into the living room with her best  welcome to our home  face . The scene she found cause every cell in her body to freeze . her breath stopped , her body refused to move , she was even certain her heart had decided not to beat . she could see she . ProtagonistI stood , talking into the darkness , while she approached from the direction of the kitchen . For one instant , the magic of seeing she for the first time took over . Its decimation was swift as terror kicked in . The sound of ProtagonistE's footsteps behind she broke she from her spell . she turned , and saw ProtagonistE clearly for the first time . ProtagonistE's smirk was playful as ProtagonistE whispered in her ear . < nl >  Thanks a lot , Goodie Two Shoes , if you had n't come out ProtagonistE could have gotten away with staying in ProtagonistE's room too .  ProtagonistE looked at she strangely when she did n't joke back . < nl >  Hey , there they are ! Where 's ProtagonistF ? she 'd just love to see ProtagonistF ..  The words came from the darkness and her voice refused to work . she looked at ProtagonistE , ProtagonistE's disgust clear as ProtagonistE moved slightly to the side , blocking the staircase . < nl >  Playing .  < nl > she cursed she for her stupidity , standing frozen when she could see her whole family . Running to ProtagonistG's room , she opened the door quickly and saw nothing .  ProtagonistG ?  she said into the void , but her answer came from the bottom of the stairs . < nl >  ProtagonistF 's in her room .  she turned to her room , taking a deep breath as she opened the door . she saw no sign of ProtagonistF , but heard ProtagonistF giggling at the other side of the room . < nl >  she got ta close the door ! ProtagonistH said ProtagonistH can only play with ProtagonistF if ProtagonistH close the door !  Sighing , she whispered calmly for ProtagonistH to stay here with the hamster and locked ProtagonistE's door quietly as she closed it . Downstairs , ProtagonistI was still talking to ProtagonistD . she had known ProtagonistD's voice instantly . ProtagonistI . < nl > she silently cursed she foe never listening to ProtagonistE . For years ProtagonistE had hated ProtagonistI , and when pressed ProtagonistE would just mutter something about  ProtagonistD's 's a creep  . she had never understood what ProtagonistE saw in ProtagonistD that was so awful , when she and the rest of the world just saw a family man . Suddenly ProtagonistI's conversation changed from background noise to the center of her attention . < nl >  Why do n't she come in , have a beer ? ProtagonistI 'm sure that family of she can spare she for a bit .  ProtagonistI offered with a smile . < nl >  Oh , they 've got all the time in the world .  < eos > 
< sos > Boston . < nl > Here Alice find she again , strolling down a valley of asphalt , glass , and concrete . she 'd been to so many like it in the last few hundred years , but each one had it 's own unique personality . < nl > she grumble to she as she wander , eyeing every  help wanted  sign she pass . Driven once again by the tiresome necessity of finding a new job like every other time she 'd moved . Ten years is a long time to some , but often not long enough . she had to leave wherever she lived before she got too tied down , before it got dangerous or people started asking too many questions . < nl > Supermarket ? Pshh , not likely . Barber ? If there was one thing she did n't want to do all day , it was touch other people 's heads . The fire company ? Ha ! Way too dangerous , she could still get hurt after all , and what 's the point of long life just to potentially throw it away on a risky job . Bookstore ? Hmmm , always a safe bet , lots to read , nice and quiet ... < nl > Ugh . Maybe she should just pull up an online job board , roll some dice and be done with it . It 's bad enough having to keep getting to know all new people every time . < nl > she glanced around at the people wandering the street . Pondering for a moment what each of them was about today . What were they each trying to make of their short little lives . One very old woman passing by looked up at she with shockingly green eyes . she froze as the spark made its way through she and erupted a powder keg of a memory buried for nearly a century . < nl > * Smoke . Flames . Heat . Oh so much heat ! * < nl > * she crouched low , groggy with sleep , still trying to get her bearings . * < nl > * When had this fire started ? How ? How did it get so far before waking she up ? she have to get out of here ! she feel like she 'm swimming in syrup . The fire is in her lungs ! No . she ca n't panic . she have to get out of here ! It wo n't end like this ! * < nl > * A cry . There 's a screaming child . No , she ca n't help , she have to get out ! But ... she 'll never stop having nightmares about this if she ignore it . There , in the crib ! Where are the parents ? Oh no , the other room is caved in . she 've got to get us out of here . Wow , she 've never seen eyes so green ... * < nl >  Excuse she she , she just ca n't help but say , she have such lovely vibrant emerald eyes .  < nl >  Oh thank she she , she sure know how to bring a smile to a lady .  < nl >  she hope she do n't mind she saying , she really seem like she 've been around quite a long time , but she have such a lively air about she .  < nl >  Ha ha , funny she should say that , she 've just recently celebrated her 100'th birthday ! she am so blessed to have been around here for so long .  < nl >  Wow , well it must 've been a great 100 years for she then !  < nl >  she might be surprised . she lost her family to a fire before she knew them , she only survived by the kindness of a mysterious stranger . she have endured many hardships . War , heartbreak , and loss . But , she never would have gotten to experience any of that if she had perished with her family . Nor would she have had the chance to cherish all the goodness and love that she now have in her life . That stranger inspired she to give everything she could to help those with nothing . It 's all been worth it , just to brighten up the lives of those she meet , even if just for a little while .  < nl > she looked up at she with a smile of deep joy .  Ah well , you youngsters have better things to do than listen to she ramble on about the good ole days . she best keep up her walk before these old joints freeze up .  < nl > For a moment , she simply stare as she slowly but surely makes her way past she and down the sidewalk with that friendly smile and still confident step .  Wait up ! Maybe she do n't have anything better to do than listen to some ramblings on a nice stroll about town .  < nl >  Oh , well that would be lovely .  < nl > As we walk , she ca n't help but marvel at the sheer chance of it all . You know , maybe she will try out that fire fighting job . After all , what 's the point of living a long time without giving some of that life to others ? < eos > 
< sos > Alice watched , unfazed , as the devil materialized amongst billowing smoke and sizzling flame in her dining room . Up until this point , she 'd been dining alone , as usual , though she wondered if the spectacle would bring the attention of her staff , or if - perhaps - this grandiosity was an illusion for her senses only . < nl > The devil was enormous , and approached she with a clawed appendage outstretched . From somewhere in the depths of her mind , she could hear the familiar raspy growl that was n't exactly words , but was unmistakable in it 's meaning . < nl > * *  she , I am here for her soul .  * * < nl > Taking her time , she wiped her mouth and set the linen napkin next to her plate . she rested her elbows on either side , tented her fingers , and leveled her gaze directly at the eyes of the devil .  No you 're not .  < nl > * *  How dare you , mortal . You signed a contract , and our deal is done . You 've achieved your goal , and built your empire . Future generations of your line should want for nothing . Your soul is the price . I am here to collect .  * * < nl >  Sole .  < nl > * *  What ?  * * < nl > With her own display of magic , she stood and procured an ancient- looking roll of parchment from thin air , and flattened it on the table in front of she . she slipped on her reading glasses , searching nimbly with her index finger for the exact line she needed in the contract .  The deal we signed was for her sole . S - o - l - e , not soul , s - o - u - l .  she pushed forward her plate of flat fish with a lemon and caper beurre blanc .  You can have this shit .  < nl > For a moment , the devil was so still , its presence seemed to absorb any light on its side of the table . Then its eyes pinched shut as an unmistakable look of pain and frustration overtook its powerful visage . It snatched up the contract , reading it over in a desperate frenzy before letting out a roar that crossed over from the plane of telepathy into actual vocal sounds .  Aaagghhh ! What the heck ! ?  < nl > she smirked . she remembered the feeling of empowerment when she first discovered the contract 's flaw . All these years , she 'd been eagerly awaiting this moment . < nl > Something made the devil pause again . A grin spread across its face , and it once again slipped back into a menacing facade . Ash and embers swirled around the room , daring to smother or spark . * *  her empire ... was it not built on the bounty of the sea ? I WILL take her sole . I will take all of it , and leave she with nothing .  * * < nl >  Motherfucker , I sell cod .  < eos > 
< sos > Alice hated Carol so much that even the act of buying magazines to cut up into a death threat filled she with rage .  Who actually buys magazines these days  , she mumbled as she searched for scissors in her messy junk drawer .  How does she always manage to make her life harder just by existing ?  she smiled and thought to she that THAT particular problem would come to an end soon enough . she had n't actually thought of what to write yet , so she decided to just cut out multiples of each letter from a  Birds and Blooms  gardening magazine . she only managed to get to  J  when she started noticing she breathing slow- something about this activity was the most soothing thing she had felt in weeks of anger and hatred . At first she thought it was the dioramas of fountains and forget - me -nots , but around the time she found she laughing and cutting out little birds to use for dotting her eyes , she realized that it was the act of creation that was turning the static hum of her hatred into excitement and anticipation . The thrill of turning mundane letters into a Warhol - esque collage set off something primal in she , and for the first time in so lomg , she found she grounded . < nl > The next day , she checked her letter box to find a piece of construction paper majestically decorated with birds , flowers , and , directly in the center , a message that read ,  I foRGiVe yoU.   Huh ,  she said ,  she wonder who that 's from ,  and went about her day . < eos > 
< sos > There was a production to the whole magic business . Alice , a group around she casting stamina spells and sleeplessness spells , and Carol keeping track of how long it was taking Elva to cast the Enigmas Tomingata . < nl > The Enigmas Tomingata was a useless spell , a day and a half long and all it did was an extravagantly clean beard trim . That being said , it was right in the sweet spot for competitive casting . < nl >  Anashalos ,  she yawned , and a wave of wakefulness came over she . she really had n't been thinking when she took this job , she 'd thought about the easy money and how easy it would be to stay in the same spot for 36 hours with a stopwatch in her hand to see if she could beat her previous record of 35 hours , 56 minutes and 45 seconds to cast the Enigmas Tomingata . What she had n't considered was how boring watching an old man try to rap nonsense would be . That being said , it was a days job , and it kept she in her apartment . < nl > The stopwatch clicked over to 35:56:46 and she considered stopping the spell . she was around the end of the incantation , somewhere around Septivus Morani which meant that she could at least let she finish . she needed a trim anyway . < nl > The spell winded down , and the group around she started to buzz . Did they really think they won ? They were off by a full minute this time around . she did n't know what had gone on , but she also did n't care . A missed attempt meant she could go home instead of staying here and signing a thousand sheets of paper . < nl > The time was revealed with a quick sorry and a bow before she ducked out of the auditorium . she had better things to do with her time then stay around she and hear she try to figure out where she 'd lost a minute . Now that she had rent it meant that she could spend the evening focusing on real magic . < nl > Solo spellcasting was something of a lost art . Sure , old men like she worked their entire lives to make sure that they were the quickest spell weavers on the market , but realistically spells were never made to be done by one man . At least not spells that had any sort of power behind them . < nl > If solo spellcasting was a nuanced practice for a more civilized age , then modern day casting was the rough , rusty cutting edge that the younger generation worked on . You did n't get one person to cast a long spell , keeping them up for several years while they stared at a book , you got a good group of people with silver tongues , and you weaved them together into spell symphonies . < nl > ProtagonistD was at the door when she got home ; ProtagonistD was doing ProtagonistD's best impression of Mom 's ' really ? ' look .  she 're running late ,  ProtagonistD commented . < nl >  she did n't break the record .  < nl >  Did she have a chance ?  ProtagonistD asked as ProtagonistD undid the chain lock . < nl >  she thought she did for a bit ,  she said as she pulled on her tie to loosen it .  Woulda only been a few minutes either way .  < nl >  she get the drinks ?  ProtagonistD asked as ProtagonistD waved she in . < nl >  Did n't think it was her turn ,  she answered . Had it been her turn ? It was ProtagonistD's turn last week which meant that- nah it was n't she . < nl >  Reg could n't make it so ProtagonistD texted she ,  ProtagonistD answered ,  whatever we can make some before starting .  < nl >  Sure thing ,  she nodded and slung her bag off her shoulder onto the floor . she knew that ProtagonistD meant ' ProtagonistD ' was going to make something instead of ' us . ' That was her job in the group as a lead caster ; she had to carry the spells when people had to take breaks . < nl > Actually , with how it turned out it mostly meant that they were covering for she when she needed a quick breath . < nl > The key with symphony casting was that people did n't just keep one another awake with small spells , we passed the spell from hand to hand rather than making one person say the entire thing . It let you cast faster , move quicker , the only issue was the occasional explosive reaction that happened when you crossed the wrong word , but that was why people called it bleeding edge , right ? < nl >  she gon na do it ?  ProtagonistD asked as ProtagonistD kicked by bag further away from the door . < nl >  Sure thing ,  she sighed and started mumbling under her breath to get the drinks conjured for practice . It was only gon na take a minute , the spell was n't had , and she was n't about to take requests . < nl > Right around the end of the spell there was another knock at the door and ProtagonistE came in without waiting for us to answer , ProtagonistE 'd started letting ProtagonistE in when ProtagonistD and ProtagonistE had become a thing and had n't stopped once they had . < nl >  That everyone ?  ProtagonistE asked she when she was in the middle of casting . she motioned to her mouth to show that ProtagonistE was an idiot for asking she and ProtagonistE rolled ProtagonistE's eyes . ProtagonistE walked away , and she started getting jugs out of the cabinets , so she did n't spill all over the counter . < nl >  Merevi ,  she finished , and the jugs all began to fill with fruit punch , it was her choice because she was casting the damn spell . < nl >  Ready for warmups ?  ProtagonistD called from the other room . That meant all six of us were here . < nl >  Skip she for the first lines ,  she yelled as she tried to get the jugs arranged so she could take them in all at once instead of making more than one trip . < nl > ProtagonistD started the disc with the base for timing , and ProtagonistE started to sing the spell . < nl > As soon as ProtagonistE spoke there was a different energy in the room , magic pulling on our tongues to try to guide us in the way that the spell was going to flow . We stopped being a group of friends and started being a group of advanturers on the white waters of casting . she took a deep breath to avoid speaking and breakin the spell as she brought drinks into the room . < nl > ProtagonistE glared at she as she came into the room as if to say ' about time ' instead of the incantation . ProtagonistE started half a word  Plyis-  < nl >  sirasi ,  she finished for ProtagonistE and she stole the reins of magic from ProtagonistE , tearing the paddle from ProtagonistE's hands and adding her energy to our effort to fight the flow of the river . < nl > * * to those interested she will be making a part 2 tomorrow on /r / Jacksonwrites based on /u / supremecrafters idea of ' awesome spells done quick . * * < eos > 
< sos > Alice kept her head down , walking through the city to her subway . her headphones were in , but silent . her glasses were dark , even though it was a cloudy day . Anything to avoid people . < nl > It was n't that she did n't like people . In fact , she was envious of almost every human interaction she saw . Out of the corner of her eye , sitting on the train , a couple of teenagers laughed - carefree . Carol was having a very animated conversation with a friend across from she . Obviously new lovers fawned over each other at the back . That was what she envied most - love . At any stage . she especially would love to even suffer through a divorce . < nl > Instead , she knew she was cursed . her shrink thought she was making this up , that it was just a series of coincidences that fueled her obsessive - compulsive traits . However , she knew better . < nl > Suddenly , Elva sat beside she jostling into her backpack .  Sorry ,  she said sheepishly ,  she am not used to the ramble of the train .  she protectively brought her backpack up onto her lap and turned slightly away .    she 'm new to the city ,  she persisted , ignoring her headphones . Perhaps she could n't see them ?  How long have she been here ?  . Idle chit - chat . If only she could risk speaking to she . It was her stop ; she was saved from this tempting torture . < nl > she bustled out of the train , pulling her backpack on and walking briskly through the station . she bounded up the stairs in twos , enjoying the blast of the cool fall air on her face when she emerged . she walked the last block to her job , the most suitable job for she - record keeping at the city hall . she worked in the basement , mostly alone except for ProtagonistD . Now she was in charge and left alone . she doubted if anybody even remembers she was there , to be honest . < nl > Just as she settled into her office , she flashed into the room smiling . < nl >  Oh hey ! From the train !  she stated . her grin was charming and fearless . < nl >  I , ugh , can I help she ?  she blurted . she almost had forgotten what her voice sounded like . Melodic , sweet , unworn by lack of use . < nl >  her apologies , she 'm Tim - the new assistant record keeper . Apparently , a woman retired so she was lucky enough to nail this job . she moved here from New Jersey just last week ; wow has it been a whirlwind , packing , finding a place , unpacking ... Oh , she 'm sorry ,  she paused , noticing her obvious bewilderment ,  she tend to ramble !  < nl > Great . she , and a rambler . A handsome man at that ...  Okay ... she ... she 'm Hope ,  she flushed ,  well , she suppose let 's get she trained .  They stood staring at each other . she started to ramble again , about her family in New Jersey . ' This is going to be a long couple of weeks ... ' she thought , secretly praying there was something she would n't like about she . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > I just ca n't understand she . she was a beautiful , smart , and secretly witty woman who would suddenly shy away from any interaction with me . There was some sort of invisible line that I ca n't see , and when I cross it , she retreats into that head of she with incredible speed . One minute her eyes would twinkle , the next , she may as well be wearing those dark sunglasses she seemed to wear like a child 's safety blanket . < nl > Despite her retreats , I have to admit - I am infatuated . I decided to win her trust , no matter the cost . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > she cried when she left she flowers in her office . she cried like she had n't cried in years . she read her note over and over and cried . she knew she 'd be in soon , even though it was Saturday , because of her note : < nl >  she - she can not get she out of her mind . When her eyes twinkle , her stomach flutters with joy . she want to spend every day , for as long as she let she , trying to make she smile . she know she planned on catching up today , but instead , she 'll be by in the morning to finally do some touristy things she keep recommending . < nl > she 're special , she . she  < nl > she looked at the clock . It had been an hour of crying , and she had n't made a plan . An escape plan . How to get out of this ? Do she flat out refuse ? Tell she she 'm a lesbian ? ? Okay , now she was just grasping at straws . Perhaps she would leave and pretend she had changed her mind ? Yes ! That 's what ... just then , the door opened . < nl >  she ?  she said quietly , entering the office ,  Did her note ... upset she ?  she could tell that she was crying . she 'm sure anybody with a set of eyes could tell she was crying . < nl >  she ... she ...  she stuttered . < nl >  It 's okay ,  she looked at her shoes ,  she 'll go .  Not knowing what to say , her heart swelling with emotions , she let she leave in silence . < nl > she slumped into the chair , prepared for another round of horrible sobs to wrack over she . she reached for the note , just to torture she again when a loud thump came from the basement door . < nl >  she ?  she said quietly into the silence , not knowing why she thought that was she . A horrible thought came over she . A very dark , horrible thought that caused panic to rise up in her throat . < nl >  she ! ?  she flew to the door , logically knowing she was being ridiculous , but her fear could n't be controlled . she whipped open the door , and suddenly it was all very real . < nl > Slumped against the door , she was bent at an unusual angle . she 'd fallen down the cement stairs . she was n't moving . she held a shaky hand by her face to feel her breath and found none . she fell on top of she , bile rising to her throat , not again ! < nl >  she ...  she choked out . How can this be ? she did n't love she ... wait , the flowers . The card . The tears , and then ... when she left after seeing she was upset . she had fallen in love , of course she had . she was starved for any interaction , any kindness , and when she walked away she had done what others would n't . she showed she that she cared for she more than she cared about her ego or her feelings , and done what she had needed she to do . < nl >  Hope ?  her heart stopped . she swear it stopped right then . Did she just .. ?  Hope ?  she said again . Suddenly she was straightening up , bones were cracking , and she was standing . < nl >  she !  she screeched , it echoed through the stairwell . < nl >  she , do n't be frightened , please ...  she looked shameful , embarrassed even . < nl >  What the fuck ? !  she shouted , confused and shaken .  she were DEAD !  < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > she looked into those terrified eyes , and it was like looking into a mirror . she had been careful to avoid anything dangerous all of her life . she took public transport instead of driving a car . she accepted a job in a records office , the most mundane safe thing she could think of . she rarely left her apartment , and she made sure that it was on the ground floor . The only thing she could n't avoid were these damn stairs , and now she knew . < nl >  Hope she can explain ...  she started , but honestly , she had no idea how to explain this . When she was a boy , she had fallen into a neighbours pool when nobody was around . she could n't swim , and she knew she was a goner . she had sunk to the bottom when she could no longer keep her head above water . It burned as she took what she believed was her final breaths , but then the escape of death did n't come . she have no idea how long she waited to die until she simply got bored , as children do , and brought she to safety . < nl > For years , she thought it was either a miracle or something she had dreamed up . That was until the car accident in high school . her best friend and his girlfriend were killed instantly , but she was left unscathed . she had felt every single bone break , even the puncture to her lung , and watched the blood pool around she . By the time the ambulance arrived , she did n't have a mark on she . she was immortal . < nl > she suddenly clutched she , and whispered her story into her ear as she sobbed quietly into her chest . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > she was still hugging she . she had finished what seemed like ages ago , and it seemed impossible to process what she was saying . So instead , she shared her story .  Every man she 've ever loved has died .  she started . Despite the fact that she had just claimed immortality , years of therapy had she feeling foolish about this statement . It was a coincidence , bad luck , it was not real . This was not real . < nl >  ProtagonistE died in a car accident driving home after the first time we made love .  she sputtered . < nl >  Then , years after ProtagonistE's death , she fell in love in college . It was a whirlwind relationship , young love . Within two weeks , ProtagonistE fell off a balcony at a party .  she looked at her hands , feeling guilty . That 's when she started to have the thoughts that it was her fault . That she had somehow controlled these events , even when she was n't there . After years of therapy and medication , she finally had the courage to date and she met ProtagonistF . No , her last victim . < nl > she was so careful with ProtagonistF . she took her time , keeping ProtagonistF at a distance for as long as she could . It lasted almost a year until ProtagonistF surprised she at her family 's lake house , with a ring . ProtagonistF died that night in ProtagonistF's sleep , right next to she . That was almost a decade ago now , but she saw ProtagonistF's face every night in her dreams . Cold and lifeless . < nl > As she finished her story , the silence surrounding she was deafening . her head swirled with emotions and confusion . All of her beliefs were suddenly validated . It was n't just a coincidence , it was real . she fell down these stairs and died too , just because she loved she ... but she was n't dead . she was immortal and standing before she despite her flaws . Despite her curse that had taken three others . < nl >  Hope ,  she broke the silence . she looked up at she . she smiled ,  Do she believe in soul mates ?  < eos > 
< sos >  What happens after Alice finish watching them all ?  asked she . < nl >  Well ,  came Carol . she could n't see she , but she sounded like Ms Perrine at school , who always had time and a kind word for them .  There 's no rush , really . she can stay here as long as she like , watching them over and over again . When she 're done , like , * really done * , she can let she know .  < nl >  And then ?  < nl >  she may then pass on ,  said she .  Your body on earth ... expires .  < nl >  Oh ,  said she .  What 's there after that ?  < nl >  Nothing ,  said she . < nl > The ten crystalline balls ( she made sure to count them ) hovered in the air , floating in that dark , inky room . she was reminded of the conservatory she had visited during her school 's science camp , where her class had been ushered into a similarly - darkened auditorium . Stars , planets , constellations had flooded the ceiling of the auditorium , one after the other , sparkling and glittering like so many diamonds out of reach . < nl >  That 's number 4 ,  said she .  she 're thinking of number 4 . Timothy even grabbed her hand during the lightshow , and did n't let go until just before the lights came back on .  < nl > Right on cue , the fourth crystal from the left shimmered an azure blue , begging for she to reach out and touch it .  Oh no , she can see that too !  said she , laughing as she covered her cheeks which had gone aflame . < nl >  There are nine others like that one ,  said she ,  the top ten important moments in your life . Pick and choose , take her time . Only when you 're ready need you move on .  < nl > she reached out instinctively , the excitement bubbling up in she . This was better than any vlog or video she could ever hope to compose on her own . Previews of her memories , perfectly captured and rendered , played out under her fingertips . she realised how lucky she was as each of the crystals yielded their secrets to she , for they invariably contained happy , cheerful memories . she cycled through the first few , loathe to move on , immersing she over and over in that endless bliss of a charmed life . < nl > Then , a thought occurred to she . < nl >  she ... she do n't remember dying ,  she said , brows furrowed .  It 's hazy , for some reason .  < nl >  she 're technically still alive ,  said she .  But if she 're curious , events leading up to it will be in the last crystal . It always counts as the last significant event , for obvious reasons .  < nl >  Will ... she be sad if she watch it ?  asked she . < nl >  It depends ,  said she .  Do n't forget , there 's always the other nine to cheer she right back up .  < nl > she hesitated , torn between the first nine crystals and the last one . she knew her mind was playing tricks on she , because where the ten of them were indistinguishable before , now the last one seemed ominous , forbidden . she found her fingers trembling just reaching out to that last crystal , and then that impulse again to lose she in the first nine , to leave that door unopened . < nl > After all , the rest really were all that she needed - one was the day that her family adopted Elva . Another was the day that her parents brought ProtagonistD home from the hospital , ProtagonistD . So many memories , so many * good * memories , all within reach , all begging for endless consumption . < nl > Never be afraid to make the tough choice , her dad 's motto sounded in her head . < nl > she sighed , then reached out for the last crystal . It unfolded when she touched it , the way a touch - me - not would , but in reverse , and light spilled out , bathing the room in an orangey glow . Shapes and sounds and feelings and thoughts coalesced around she , and for a moment it felt like she was back in the moment , reliving that very memory . she recognised the scene immediately . < nl >  Such a beautiful drive ,  said she .  she were playing all the way with ProtagonistD , were she not ?  < nl >  Yes ,  said she .  Six hours to Disneyland , Dad said . The hours flew by though . We talked about school , ProtagonistD told she about the boy ProtagonistD had a crush on , we napped , we snacked , we counted the number of cars which passed us ...  < nl > Then , the memory cut off , dousing the room back in an oily gloom . It looped again soon after , right back where it first started , as if it had never stopped in the first place . < nl >  That 's all she remember of it ?  asked she . < nl >  That 's all she witnessed ,  offered she . < nl >  Can she tell she ... what happened after that ?  < nl > A short silence , and for a moment she wondered if she had gone away . she returned just as she thought to ask the question again . < nl >  There are n't any rules about this ,  said she ,  and she do n't suppose there 's any harm in it . There was an accident , she . Someone else had fallen asleep at the wheel , drifted into her lane .  < nl >  That 's not good ,  said she .  Are ... they ok ? Mum , Dad ? ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  They 're fine . All of them . In fact , they 're right there beside she now , watching and waiting for she to recover . There are machines hooked up to she , keeping she alive ... but just barely .  < nl > she looked back at the other crystals , and then it occurred to she why they seemed so familiar .  Time moves differently here , does n't it ,  she said , flitting through the other memories .  How long have she been here , looking through these ?  < nl >  Not that long ,  said she . < nl >  How long ?  < nl >  About a year ?  < nl > she smiled , then released the crystal she had been holding in her hand . It rose slowly , floating up to join the others , until they were arranged neatly in a row again . she could n't deny that it was nice being here , looking back at the memories , reliving them , savouring them . < nl > Knowing that her family was out there waiting for she to return though , took some of that shine away . she did n't like to keep anyone waiting . < nl >  she 'm ready .  < nl >  she sure ?  asked she . < nl >  Yes ,  she said . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos > Carol had asked several times to go home , but Alice said that she no longer remembered where Earth was located . she had gotten the coordinates from a trading partner , and after they had abducted she she had overwritten that file with a note to the cleaning crew . * Make sure she gets watered . * < nl > That had been an unpleasant and terrifying awakening , but soon the crew knew the basics of human care . she was just lucky that she came from an oxygen based planet and she had n't died . They told her stories of other ships filled with water or different gasses , some of the stranger aliens looking forlorn at the tanks on their heads . < nl > They started out giving she small tasks , but soon she graduated to some of the most important jobs on the ship . Most of the crew needed 2 to 3 times the sleep she did , so she often ended up running the engine room by she . she had n't known anything about engines before , but the one in this ship was so simple and optimized that it was n't difficult to learn . This astounded her crewmates , as they all had the equivalent of a bachelor 's degree to understand it . < nl > The artificial gravity on the spacecraft was extremely light . While others walked or slithered normally , she could cover a room in a single bound . she thought this was actually very fun and , since she was much smaller than the rest of the crew , was asked to do many repairs in high or hard to reach places . she really did n't mind . < nl > she soon became her favorite , though she treated she more as a pet than a person . she found a planet that grew cocoa beans and would regularly buy chocolate just for she . she made sure to handle these boxes she , as the chocolate was toxic to the rest of the crew . < nl > As for the crew themselves , they treated she with cautious respect . They would joke around with she but would avoid upsetting she at all costs . It may have had something to do with she accidentally shattering a ceramic plate once . she felt like she was always stopping them from doing stupid things , such as grabbing live wires and making sure they wore their protective suits when doing outside repairs . she felt like a mom sometimes . < nl > That 's why when they passed a little planet in a tiny galaxy that looked quite familiar , she chose to say nothing . she was already home . < eos > 
< sos > Carol expected it to be beautiful . < nl > Rolling meadows , fields of wild flowers , the wild scent of fresh lavender and cedar . < nl >  Alice love you ,  she would proclaim . < nl >  her beauty burns , her eyes torture , her body torments she .  < nl > Blah , blah , blah . < nl > she 'd found she riveting at one point , a young woman drifting through life rather aimlessly , unable to discern a true purpose , but instead filled with an indelible lack of purpose . < nl > Jazz clubs , disco clubs , dance clubs , they all were the same to she now . < nl > A different part of she remembers the draw , the pull towards intoxicants and their inevitable fallout , that heartless love born of mindless lust . < nl > There she met she . < nl > 50s , 60s , 70s , 80s , 90s , the years blew she by . < nl > How she loved she , she claimed .   How she needed she , she would croon . < nl > Lust .   A woman can live a few lifetimes and still be a fool . < nl > she still remembered , a smoke filled bar shortly after the Japs surrendered , a young man in a tan suit reclining at a restricted table , laughing wildly and drinking liberally as women seemed to fawn over she . < nl > she had found she rather dull .   Repulsive , in fact . < nl > Unfortunately , that provoked she into paying attention to she . < nl > First mistake . < nl > Around building corners , at parties , at the fucking grocery store she would appear , always charming and handsome , but somewhat wrong .   Always off . < nl > she ignored her instinct and decided to give she a chance . < nl > Second mistake . < nl > she would sing to she , play music to she , recite poems and laud she with praise .   A pedestal she placed she upon , which at first seemed delightful .   Until her narcissism kicked in . < nl > Do n't go here , do n't talk to them , stay inside , do what she say . < nl > So she refuses . < nl > Then POOF , here comes Elva . < nl > And old Gods carry magic . < nl > she would scorn she , ignore she , beg she to leave she , but she would not .   she simply adored she more . < nl > Then the third strike . < nl > she gave she a terminal disease . < nl > she needed she to be in her grasp forever , to always be at her beck and call , to satisfy she whenever she so chose . < nl > Total bullshit .   A curse . < nl > she died in a rather unenthusiastic manner , a car T - boned her ass rather well .   Instantaneous death .   No pain . < nl > she awoke in a tomb , or what seemed to be a tomb .   The air held heavy , tasting of copper and cedar , a thick orange smoke pervading the space . < nl > Unable to reason , she crawled forward .   she did not know why , but simply complied .   The unwillingness of the dead . < nl > she arose , confused and scared , in what appeared to be a metropolis from a different time . < nl > All full of women . < nl > she moved forward , confounded by what she saw , a thousand languages and a million women , all bartering and fighting and scrapping . < nl > ProtagonistD stopped and stared . < nl >  New here ?  ProtagonistD asked , carrying a bundle of something . < nl > A nod in response . < nl >  What a shame .  < nl > Shocked silence . < nl >  Shall ProtagonistD show ProtagonistD around ?  < nl > A dull nod . < nl >  Come with ProtagonistD , she , and ProtagonistD can tell she how to avoid she .  < nl > ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- < nl > Wander . < nl > Thin streets , wide streets .   Those that smell of roses and thyme , and those that smell of shit and disease . < nl > she is scared and alone here .   Dead or undying , she can not discern .   Rather , there is only a sense of dread .   she .   In a world of mist and blackness , a great hall of missing corpses . < nl > Ahead of she , ProtagonistE leads .   By hand and wrist ProtagonistE pulls and drags , revealing newer and wider plazas and passages .   Somehow , ProtagonistE's age is stripped by ProtagonistE's movements , every patch of time showing a younger and freer version of ProtagonistE .   ProtagonistE was someone else , long ago .   Someone dead and gone . < nl > she finds she following a long dead woman , into a passage of columns .   Some drip with blood , other with milk and honey .   Either way , she knows not to touch the massive pillars of limestone . < nl > Others are meant to lick the sweet and metallic taste of blood . < nl > she finds she descending , not through stairs but a ramp , flanked by walls of a strange earthy substance .   There is not a method of surveillance of any human kind , but the strange eyes of the Gods bore through her nape . < nl > Ambrosia , mead , wine , beer , meat , jerky all blend together , pouring through her nostrils .   Those who wander the land of the dead are either damned or blessed .   Yet here she wafts , being neither . < nl > she places a hand against her cheek , a thin smile cresting over sharpened teeth . < nl >  Those of our beauty must take extraordinary measures .  < nl > she reaches below , placing a crown of tangled statuesque snakes upon her head . < nl >  she served her time , as Helen of Troy .  < nl > The crown begins to writhe , alive in its own right . < nl >  To hide from her advances , we rely on the power of other Gods .  < nl > Wildness through her hair , snakes through her scalp twist among the hairs there .   A monster is her reduction .   she recalls the fables and myths , but can not reconcile the reality .   Death is eternal .   Is she to be a monster for eternity ? < nl > Gods of every faith and denomination can not breach her power , however . < nl > But she finds she , clutching her knees and weeping .   she misses her mother and clouds .   she misses her father and brother , her sisters and her friends .   she does not want to be dead , she wants to fight she . < nl > Now she can only feel hate and rage , clasping fingertips , almost sensing throats below them , satisfied by the life lost beneath them . < nl > she has dissipated into a smoke , but what remains is a being consumed in hate .   she did not ask for an Old God , nor did she offer any sacrifice . < nl > The snakes wriggle within her hair , and it makes she happy .   Others will submit to this newfound power . < nl > she feels an unremarkable call to the lost metropolis .   To fight she , to regain her freedom .   To have a life of her own , to find her family and apologize for her sins .   she wanted the best for them , but the lust of a Dead God forced she into this state . < nl > Medusa is a weakling , Athena is a cunt . < nl > she is vengeance incarnate , blessed with the power of the unwilling dead . < nl > she will go home . < nl > her captor will suffer . < nl > -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- < nl > r / storiesfromapotato < eos > 
< sos > Carol was a matryoshka painter .   At sunset , Alice would knock on the apartment door with her wheelbarrow beside she .   she would give she all the plain figurines that she had carved that day , curving the balsam wood into the prospect of a head , shoulders and torso , then cutting Elva at her waist so that her legs would twist off , and hide her secrets .   she would pay she five hundred rubles for each full matryoshka and then she would go to her workshop ( which was in fact only just the corner of her father 's kitchen behind the stove ) and she would paint the wood into ProtagonistD . < nl > she would paint ProtagonistD with long eyelashes and blushing cheeks , and she would wonder what it would feel like to blush and flutter her own eyes , if ever a kind and handsome man were to pour vodka into a glass , and hand it to she , letting his fingertips pass over she .   she would paint ProtagonistD wearing elegant dresses adorned with tulips and roses , and she would imagine sewing an elegant silk dress to wear she .   she would give the woman full - hearted smiles , and she would try to remember the last time she had smiled , apart from when she meant to attract the customers to her booth at the Udelnaya .   And then she would paint the next doll nested within , more intricately , but otherwise the same .   However , at ProtagonistD's core , ProtagonistD contained a protest : open ProtagonistD up to ProtagonistE , and you will find that ProtagonistE is not smiling or blushing , but instead has short eyelashes and a stern gaze . ProtagonistE wears only a plain grey dress .   For though she painted matryoshka , she had never known ProtagonistH , and therefore knew that not all daughters will inherit . < nl > In the morning , she would pack ProtagonistD in a box and take the bus to the Udelnaya , hoping to sell her work .   Most days , she would be lucky to sell two or three matryoshka .   But there was one day when she sold none at all , yet left the Udelnaya joyful . On that day , ProtagonistF had come to the market .   There , ProtagonistF saw she at her booth with the shelves of matryoshka behind she , all red and green , gold and blue , and ProtagonistF was enamored . < nl >  ProtagonistF have never seen a woman who ProtagonistF am more certain has a secret hiding inside her ,  ProtagonistF said to she .   ProtagonistF was wearing a gold watch and many silver rings .   she told ProtagonistF that ProtagonistF could buy as many matryoshka as ProtagonistF wished , and discover everything within them .   But then ProtagonistF said ProtagonistE was not any of ProtagonistD , but she . < nl > ProtagonistF gave she a piece of paper with directions to an elegant restaurant on the banks of the Moyka River . ProtagonistF ProtagonistF gave she ProtagonistF's credit card as well .   ProtagonistF told she that were she to go buy a nice dress , that ProtagonistF would be honored to see she in it , and dine with she that evening .   she blushed , and then she smiled , even though she had not sold a matryoshka . < nl > That evening , instead of painting , she went to the best boutique in St Petersburg , and she bought a beautiful silk dress .   she then met ProtagonistF at the appointed restaurant .   ProtagonistF spread caviar onto crackers for she , and poured she some vodka .   ProtagonistF asked she about her life , how many matryoshka she supposed she had painted , and if any were very special to she .   But , as the meal continued , she began to feel more and more confused and dizzy , until everything became terribly blurry .   When she awoke , she was no longer in the restaurant or in the small bed beside her father 's .   she was standing upright , but frozen in pose , perched on a gold podium in a white expanse , more still and desolate than the Tauride Gardens after the first snowfall .   she was lined up neatly between a hundred other young women , all immobile as well . < nl >  Where am she  she asked ,  who are you all ?  < nl >  ProtagonistF ,  the young woman beside she explained ,  was not in truth a man , but ProtagonistG .   ProtagonistG keeps us here as figurines , upon ProtagonistG's shelf for all eternity .   ProtagonistG tells us that long ago , ProtagonistG once loved a goddess called Anna , who also had no mother , who was the First Woman , and that we remind ProtagonistG of ProtagonistH .   When ProtagonistH birthed their child , the girl was mortal .   So ProtagonistG sought to kill the child as an abomination .   But ProtagonistH loved the baby , so ProtagonistH fled the heavens to the Barsky taiga .   ProtagonistG chased ProtagonistH all through the trees , but ProtagonistH refused to return , and at last a bargain was struck : ProtagonistH would remain in the Barsky with ProtagonistH's daughter , but thereafter ProtagonistH would become mortal as well .   But , if any of ProtagonistH's descendants to ever live without a mother , ProtagonistG would be entitled to reclaim ProtagonistD and bring ProtagonistD here , to remain forever in ProtagonistG's collection .  < nl > she was crestfallen at the thought of never again seeing her father or St Petersburg , and of being frozen in place .   she screamed out to ProtagonistG and demanded to be freed .   But ProtagonistG just laughed , all throughout ProtagonistG's menagerie . < nl > But then , after many days of considering her plight , she formed a plan .    Allow she to turn ProtagonistG's collection into matryoshka ! ,  she called out to ProtagonistG ,  Let she separate each of ProtagonistD into pieces , into clear layers , so that ProtagonistG might consider each part of ProtagonistD more easily , and find what it is in each of ProtagonistD that resembles ProtagonistH !  < nl > her proposal thrilled ProtagonistG , for even after all ProtagonistG's abductions , ProtagonistG was still no closer to grasping what it was that makes a motherless woman so special , so like the First Woman .   ProtagonistG released her muscles and demanded that she go to work at once , separating and straining each of ProtagonistD into a partwise matryoshka . < nl > From where ProtagonistG watched , it appeared to ProtagonistG she was doing as she had promised .   But each time ProtagonistG's back was turned , or when she carefully angled her subject and stood nose to nose , she would reach inside ProtagonistI , and she would pull forth ProtagonistI's soul , which lives in ProtagonistI's deepest layer .   she would hide the soul in her bosom until she could move on and quietly feed it to another girl , until ProtagonistJ had taken in the soul of one of ProtagonistJ's fellow captives .   Finally , she pulled out her own soul and fed it to the woman whom she had been first placed beside .   At last , each captive woman had taken in the soul of another , thereby promising to care for it and nurture it .   Because of this , the women of the menagerie had all become mothers to each other , and were no longer in thrall to ProtagonistG . < nl > ProtagonistG saw that she was no longer hard at work , so ProtagonistG returned to inspect her progress .   But as ProtagonistG entered the menagerie , all the captives suddenly broke from their poses .   All together , they hit and kicked ProtagonistG , until ProtagonistG fled .   The menagerie with all its gold podiums vanished , and ProtagonistD fell through a void , until everything again became blurry . she awoke in her small bed in her father 's apartment in St Petersburg . < nl > That night , she came at sunset with the blank wood for she .   For the first time , she did not paint the final doll with a stern face and grey dress .   For now , she knew that somewhere there was a woman who would always carry her soul , always nurture and protect it , and that this meant she would always have a mother to inherit from . < eos > 
< sos > Alice's appearance was close enough to resemble human , but she was much taller with two pairs of lithe arms , and eyes that were as dark as ink wells . she stood before her throne and looked down upon a crowd of various races . < nl > Calmly ,  Tell it to she again .  she said . Commanding her room full of advisors that gathered . her restrained rage was unnerving to her subjects , they all knew she was furious . < nl > There was a shove from one of the advisors , pushing another foreward . Carol . she too was near human in apperance . < nl >  Well ...  she struggled to find the words .  From what we surmize ... After initial seeding of the planet ... They developed according to predictions .  she paused for a moment . < nl >  And then ?  Said she . < nl >  Well , in their history they developed something called ' democracy ' , and they strayed from the proper systems of governance . It spread like a cancer ever since .  < nl >  What of their kings and queens ?  she said .  The central powers of nations ?  < nl >  Well ... Reduced to figure heads . Now the entire planet has become a democracy and -- after a brief rule on their fourth planet , Elon Musk King of Mars ... There has n't been a ruling monarchy since . They each vote and have equal say on their leaders and law .  < nl >  And what of her daughters ?  she said .  Did they at least find suitable ' leaders ' in their government to strengthen our alliances ?  < nl >  They ... Are refusing to marry , and are choosing to stay among the humans . They are saying they have the right to choose what they do with their lives .  < nl > There was a murmur in the crowds as they begun to consider the host of strange new ideas they have been receiving from the humans , and they considered the implications . < nl > she nodded ...  Send the fleet . Glass the planets .  < eos > 
< sos > The air stinks of false pleasantries . < nl > Around a table , representatives of the mightiest empire the galaxy had ever known sits across from the upstarts in the Sol system .   A cybernetically enhanced group of humanoid creatures bearing a striking resemblance to the species of emperors and empresses .   Only a primary difference in skin color and texture , slightly metallic as a natural evolution to a heavily radiated environment . < nl > A human delegation rises and give bows of feigned respect .   They have something they call a United Nations governing their systems and colonies , making communicative talks difficult .   Too many humans have too many different forms of power .   No way to isolate and eliminate their leadership .   Their defining characteristic a hatred among their species for different beliefs , governments , even skin colors .   But all humans share one common attribute . < nl > An intense hatred of all alien races .   The way they see it , humans would rather wipe out all opposing life , in order to focus on kill each other .   Ca n't exactly blame them .   The empire had n't made a peaceful first contact . < nl > Alice rises and gives a slight nod .   her generals and entourage fume , such respect is unworthy of such an entitled race . < nl > Humans are fickle .   Loud , violent , loving , hopeful , arrogant , intelligent , idiotic .   No one set of morals defines them . < nl > Nearly limitless resources , ships , armies , planets and systems kneel before her throne .   Every other race would bow and scrape , awed at the magnificence of the Imperial Fleet and the limitless might of the Empire . < nl > Not the humans . < nl > There is silence .   Neither side aims to move first . < nl > she waves a hand .   A signal . < nl > Carol rises , puffs out her chest , and reads into a translator . < nl >  We are willing to discuss terms for an armistice .  < nl > Stone faced humans .   No emotions from them , and no body language to express any kind of reaction .   Perhaps the electronics make them unable to feel . < nl > A human stands and speaks into his translator , as another moves a document towards the imperial delegation .   One rises to take it , and opens it before she . < nl >  We have terms .   They are non - negotiable .  < nl > she can sense the fury of her generals , some of their arms quiver with rage .   Their teeth are clenched , eyes narrowed . < nl > she reads the terms . < nl > Immediate cessation of all conflict . < nl > Tributes of various sorts , technological , material , financial . < nl > Trade policies specifically benefiting human settlements . < nl > Surrender of nearly four dozen star systems near their Sol system . < nl > Dissolution of the Empire . < nl > she makes a brief comment and she stands again , speaking into that black box .   If she grips it any harder it will shatter . < nl >  We can not agree to the dissolution of the empire .  < nl > The humans stand in unison , sighing as if they 've heard a terrible joke . < nl >  Either agree to the terms , or we will employ them by force .  < nl > The aliens rise .   It is futile , true .   Human weapons are too precise , their drones vastly outnumbering her own pilots .   Every ship in her invincible army outclassed and outgunned . < nl > But she had her pride . < nl > she turned to leave , condemning her people to death . < nl > Humans would talk about the first contact war as a minor spat .   Ancient cultures ground into dust by their own hands . < nl > None had pity for the dead . < nl > -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- < nl > r / storiesfromapotato < eos > 
< sos >  Usually when we first contact a civilization , it is very easy to get them under our banner ...  Alice sighed .  ... Not the humans though .  < nl > The assembled collection of interplanetary rulers looked on , faces carefully blank as to not show any emotion that might set she into a rage . Long has it been since she claimed her throne amongst the many countless galaxies she had enslaved , and since then her temper has been legendary for its ferociousness . < nl >  They are ...  she started , before trailing off as if the very words she needed had eluded she .  They are beyond our understanding .  < nl > The gathered conglomerate of rulers collectively gasped , all pretense of decor abandoned in the face of what she had just stated . she was a rock , an infallible source of leadership and knowledge . To admit that there was something that was beyond she was so rare that none of the species present , some of which lived for centuries , could not remember a moment where it had happened before . < nl > A brave Clixperr , a race of blue - skinned , four eyed insectoids , raised his hand .  Err , she ? What do she mean ? I mean no disrespect , but I find it hard to believe that those ... Dirt Walkers ... could be beyond she .  < nl > her left antennae twitched , which was usually the first and only sign any creature got before they were removed from existence . Instead of incinerating the creature who dared talk out of turn , however , she simply closed her eyes and took a deep breath , before answering . < nl >  They are ... a confusing sort ,  she replied , temporarily forgiving her subject .  They do n't react the way most sentient creatures do .  < nl > No one spoke without being addressed this time . Life flashed before their eyes once . It was more than enough for one day . Noticing the obedient silence , she continued . < nl >  Our scouting drones reported back a backwater civilization . They are barely out of Beta Stage of development .  < nl > Most aliens at her table shared a condoned laugh . Beta Stage of Civilized Development was the point where a civilization stopped fighting each other over resourced deemed valuable in the Alpha Stage , and started working coherently toward space travel . < nl > There had n't been a Beta Stage planet in millennia . < nl > The different creatures reveled in their mockery for scant minutes more before she spoke up once more , her silent words cutting through the chatter like a knife .  And yet , their technology has already reached that of Nevulon Five 's .  < nl > Nevulon Five , while not the most technologically advanced of the planets under her rule , was among the best regardless . The room fell into silence once more . < nl >  But ... how ?  Carol asked . she , apparently feeling generous , let she keep her life as well . Such was the extent that the humans unnerved she . < nl >  We ... are unable to tell ,  she sighed .  That is but an example of a much bigger , underlying problem .  she leaned forward , and as one , every other person in the room leaned back .  The humans squabble . They have clear , unrestrained hatred for one another , and everything in our databases say they should take themselves out . And yet ... they do n't . They continue to thrive amongst each other even though most of their technological and sociological advances are based towards killing each other . They adapt to harsh environments for the sole purpose of proving a point , and they constantly ingest near toxic substances and perform near deadly feats to simply prove they can .  < nl > The room was deathly silent . No one dared utter a word about such odd , terrifying creatures . < nl >  Honestly , they are quite impressive . Quite insane , but in a way that would be entertaining . she believe we should extend every courtesy to get them to join . All those against ?  < nl > No one dared oppose . The question was a challenge , not a request . < nl >  Good . Meeting adjourned .  < nl > As the creatures left , she smiled a wicked smile . she told none of them of the humans ' tendency to conquer . They would no doubt go on a spree to eliminate everyone weaker than them , most likely starting with the weaker planets in her own kingdom . < nl > At worse ? They would overthrow she . At best , they would whip the more pathetic ones into shape . she shrugged , at least it would be amusing . < nl > And most entertaining indeed . < eos > 
< sos > Welcome to Magnolia : a city without birth , without death ; a city where all your dreams become reality , until you 've lived them so God - damned often that they become a waking nightmare . Welcome to Magnolia : a city where our leading doctors will Skim off the last few hundred years of your life as if they were only fat deposits on your thighs , so that you can enjoy the thrills and spills of living all over again .   Welcome to Magnolia : a city that 's rotten to its core and whose denizens are as dry as tinder , who are only waiting for Alice to ignite them and turn them into a raging inferno . < nl > her name might be Richard Eizenstat . she 's at the very least responsible for the placid pool of red that 's stained my boots ; she 's responsible for Elva's body , that lies like a pale island in the center of the blood . < nl >  Thank you for coming ,  says Carol . I recognise she from the holos . < nl >  Why 'd she do it ?  I ask , my voice an echoing growl around the small room . < nl >  she ... she was a sick man , Mr O'connell . Very sick .  she taps the side of her head twice .  Cerebral haemorrhage during the Step - Back .  < nl > I frown .  Step - Backs do n't go wrong . Is n't that her slogan ?  < nl >  her * slogan * , if you must call it that , is One Step - Back , Two Steps Forward .  < nl >  My mistake . Still , I 've never heard of a Step - Back going wrong before .  < nl >  Well this one did ,  she replies sternly . < nl > The institution 's white room is empty apart from us . she does n't want this news getting out . I crouch down over the body , my knees hovering an inch above the blood . The corpse is cold and the arms are stiff but pliable . * Just * . < nl >  Maybe five hours since death , I reckon .  < nl > A dozen or so wide wounds lattice her torso . A long , triangular shard of glass lies by her side . There 's blood along the tip of the glass , where it stabbed she , and there 's blood all down its sides , too . ProtagonistD's hands must be pretty messed up right now . I wonder why ProtagonistD 'd stab ProtagonistD so many times ? It 's like a * crime passionnel * , as the ancient Europeans might have said . < nl >  Come , follow she ,  says she .  she have something she need to show you .  < nl > she leads me through one of the institutions hallways full of locked iron doors , and I 'm already burning with curiosity . I hear noises from within the rooms : scraping , banging ... * screaming * . If nothing ever goes wrong during the Step - Backs , then who the hell are behind those doors ? < nl > We come out into a small room with an expensive looking table in the middle -- authentic wood , by the look of it . A deep , rich brown -- mahogany , maybe -- with decorative carvings around its eves . Thing must be worth as much as my apartment . < nl > Two chairs sit either side of the table . It 's the type of room I 'd have done interrogations in , once upon a time . Although , with a cheap pine table between us instead , with a couple of stained mugs full of steaming coffee marking its surface . < nl >  Sit , please ,  she says . It 's a demand not a request -- same with all the bullshit questions she asks . I pull out a chair and slump down onto it . < nl >  You perhaps know who she am , already ?  < nl > I grin .  I would n't be much of a detective if I did n't . she Daughter of Jonathan Browning , once of the three founders of Magnolia . As pretty as you are ruthless ... * so they say * .  < nl > For the first time since meeting she , she allows she a smile .  Oh , do * they * ? How nice of them . And she suppose you know why she 've asked for your help ?  < nl >  Seeing as I 'm the only detective in the city -- the only person with any real experience with murder cases , she suspect you need me . she mean ... * a dead body * ?  I let out a slow whistle .  That 's already going to look bad against her record . And if ProtagonistE does n't get caught ... well , it 'll be historic , to say the least .  < nl >  ProtagonistE wo n't get away !  she shouts , slamming a fist hard against the table . Almost instantly , she returns to her equable demeanour .  You will see to that , she am sure of it . Now , tell she , Mr O'connell-  < nl >  ProtagonistF .  < nl >  * ProtagonistF . * Why is ProtagonistF still have ProtagonistF's memories from during the Restart ? Surely it would be best for ProtagonistF to erase them -- they ca n't be pleasant to hold onto .  < nl > ProtagonistF flinch .  They 're not . But ProtagonistF figured someone has to keep these skills alive . Murder does n't wait forever . Immortality is bullshit -- all we 've done is cure ageing . And even that means nine hours a night in a vecta - coffin .  < nl > she cringes .  she do so hate that name . ProtagonistF will call it the Restorative Cube , from here on .  < nl > ProtagonistF shrug . < nl > she stares at ProtagonistF , drinking ProtagonistF in . ProtagonistF imagine most people find her stony gaze imposing , but ProtagonistF just stare right back . < nl >  ProtagonistF must be so very bored ,  she says lugubriously . < nl >  ProtagonistF 've only just gotten here . Besides , she 're not so dull .  < nl > she laughs .  Not of this . * Of everything * . Of life . Of living . ProtagonistF must have done everything possible a hundred times over , and yet ProtagonistF 've not had ProtagonistF's memory Reset . ProtagonistF 're somewhat of a freak , ProtagonistF .  < nl >  I prefer * unique * . Tell she about ProtagonistG .  < nl >  ProtagonistG ... happened two months ago . The Step - Back failure . she ... her mind , her * memories * have leaked into each other . she does n't know what 's reality , and what 's fiction . A holomovie from last year , for example -- she can no longer tell if it happened to she in real life , if * she * was the protagonist -- or if it was indeed just a holomovie .  < nl >  So ...  < nl >  So , she has a lot of dangerous memories right now . she believes she has inherited many of these memories not from movies , but from other denizen 's Skims .... Skims from before the Restart .  < nl >  * Before ? *  < nl >  Yes .  < nl >  That 's ...  I whistle .  Those memories would be from long before even my time . And hell , I 'm as old as they come .  < nl >  If they were real memories , yes . But they are n't . They are fabrications .  < nl >  So , she 're saying she thinks that movies she 's watched are * real * memories , but from other people . People 's memories from Before .  < nl >  Exactly . she 's paranoid beyond reason .  < nl > she opens a drawer and takes out a large brown folder . she slides it across the desk to ProtagonistF .  It is best ProtagonistF know what ProtagonistF 're up against .  < nl >  What happens once I 've caught she ?  < nl >  she 's a heretic . We Reset she . There is no choice .  < nl >  And to me ?  < nl >  We Skim ProtagonistF's memory back two days prior to this meeting , and for ProtagonistF none of this ever happened .  < nl >  Then why the hell would I help she ? What 's the point ?  < nl >  ProtagonistF's bank account will know what ProtagonistF did . ProtagonistF's new apartment will know , and ProtagonistF's new -Platinum Forged memories will know . Beyond that , ProtagonistF will have done ProtagonistF's city a great favour that wo n't be forgotten -- at least , not by she .  < nl > I grunt , then nod and flip open the folder . < nl > > * * ProtagonistF with she * * < nl > > * * Session one * * < nl > > she : What is ProtagonistF's name ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : Polynomine < nl > > she : Polynomine ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : We have many names . < nl > > she : ProtagonistF's name is Richard Eizenstat . < nl > > ProtagonistH : We were ProtagonistD . We are now more . Many more . Much more . < nl > > she : ProtagonistF's name is Richard Eizenstat and ProtagonistF experienced an accident during Step - Back . < nl > > ProtagonistH : There was no accident . < nl > > she : What do ProtagonistH mean ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : Someone wanted us to become what we are . To see what there was and is and will be . < nl > > she : ... ProtagonistH believe someone sabotaged the Step - Back ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : Yes . < nl > > she : Who ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : We do n't know . There are many voices in our head and they bay for justice like starving wolves : uncontrollable and savage . We can not control them yet . We can not quieten them enough to hear the voice beneath . < nl > > she : What is ProtagonistH's first memory ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : We have many first memories . < nl > > she : What do ProtagonistH know of the Restart ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : It is a lie . There was no Restart . < nl > > she : A lie ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : We are taught what it is . A perfect new beginning . But it is not . < nl > > she : Then what was it ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : The mass extinction of humanity . < nl > > she : Extinction ? What caused this * extinction * ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : Clones . < nl > > she : * Clones ? * < nl > > ProtagonistH : Yes , clones . Like , she . This body too , she . But -- but there is humanity left . It is inside our head . And we will set them free ! We will set them all free ! < nl > > * Notes * : ProtagonistD's eyes dilate massively as ProtagonistD screams and struggles against ProtagonistD's restraints , the metal biting into ProtagonistD's wrists until they bleed . I call in security and they apply the tranquilliser to ProtagonistD's neck . It takes five minutes or so for ProtagonistD's body to go limp . It should have taken seconds . < nl > > * * End of session one * * < nl > I look away from the document and up at she . < nl >  Clones ?  I ask . < nl >  Outlawed tech , even before the Restart . Marked as abominations .  < nl >  Yeah , I know ... It 's just a surprise to me that she thinks clones could be responsible , seeing as they were never anything more than an idea .  < nl >  Yes , she would think that .  she sighs .  she suppose she should be honest with you , you 'll forget it all soon enough . Sometime before the Reset -- she do n't know all the details -- a handful of clones were produced for limited , closed testing . But ... there was an incident ...  < nl >  We created clones ? Jesus ...  I raise my eyebrows as I consider the implications .  So , what was incident ?  < nl >  There 's very little information on it , even in her own archives -- as is the case with anything pre - Reset . But what she do know is that something went wrong during the closed testing . What exactly , she ca n't say . But suffice it to say , clones never made it to market release , and any research into them was destroyed and made illegal thereafter . Instead , she concentrated on limited AI subserviencey .  < nl >  So she could be telling the truth ? I mean , not fully -- but maybe there 's something in it ?  < nl >  No . There 's * no * possibility of it .  < nl > I nod and return to the document . < nl > --- < nl > Part 2 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/7c0viz/wp_everyone_is_immortal_in_the_distant_future_to/ < nl > Part 3 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/7c1pt0/wp_everyone_is_immortal_in_the_distant_future_to/ < eos > 
< sos > * * Yes , Yes !   This will be perfect , Carol's most fiendish plan yet . * * A shadowy sat at an immense desk made from black iron and ebony hued wood , a long quill that radiated a fell aura scratched eerily on a roll of parchment .   The room flickered with light from the fire place , a scent of spice and dark earth permeated the air .   The figure was immense , looming over the desk , wings sprouted from its back and flapped unconsciously , swirling the air .   Its focus was totally on the work before it , arcane symbols and script written in neat handwriting . < nl > The heavy iron door slid open slowly on oiled hinges .   Small clicks of talons on stone preceded Alice , they strode into the chamber with inhuman grace .   her figure oozed confidence , allure , seductive danger that lies just beneath the surface of her motions .   Cold yellow eyes with stilted pupils gazed at the shadow figure , a curve of a cruel lip hinted at a smile and she stood at its side in silence .   Eventually she coughs , a quiet noise that shot across the room . < nl > * * Ah , she .   What brings she to her chamber . * * The shadow did n't turn from its task , continuing to write and make other hidden notes on an other scroll of parchment . < nl > she bowed , arm sweeping out in an old fashioned gesture .    her Dread Lord Vel'tora , Lord of Shadows , Knight of the Ebon Chalice .   Doom scribe , Chronicler of the Outer Black-  < nl > * * Yes yes , those are her titles .   Thank she she .   Why are she interrupting her work ?   she have little time left before she begin her next task .   All must be ready . * * < nl > she floated closer , curiosity written all over her face and she could n't keep a tone of wonder from her voice .    We , her humble servants , are ... curious she .   We have noticed that she have been busy of late , especially every 7th day .   she keep to she in here and we wished to offer our services .   We would delight in aiding she .  < nl > she nodded , calmly as if knowing this all along .   * * You aid is appreciated if unnecessary .   Your goals are to continue to maintain the estates , protect the realm , and prepare for the next Confluence of Fire .   This matter is .... personal . * * < nl > Curiosity piqued , she tried to wheedle some more .    Personal she ?   Please , she know of her abilities .   she could help she .   she heard she speak of her most fiendish plan yet .   she ca n't help but-  The breath froze in her throat as she turned and gave she her attention .   her knees buckled and she fell to the floor , bowing her head in contrition .    M - her apologies she !   Please forgive she !  < nl > she turned away and a weight lifted off of she .   * * No matter .   she do not draw her ire .   In any other task she would welcome her assistance .   However this task is she , and mine alone .   Perhaps it will be repeated for she , and she will learn in time . * * < nl > Before she could speak again the air shivered , a silver bell began to ring filling the air with a quivering tinkle .   she turned to a large mirror along one wall , a light pouring forth from reflection .   * * Ahh , it is time .   she will return in several hours she .   she are in command of the Citadel until her return . * *   she gathered up the rolls of parchment and glided to the mirror .   With a touch it blazed with light causing she to look away .   Blinking away the after images she left the chambers , daring a glance at the mirror .   * A table ? * < nl > The room filled with plumes of inky purple smoke .   The walls quaked and from the smoke rose the cowled form of Vel'tora .   * * she have returned to the Mortal plane !   Who dares summon she and are you prepared to pay the price ? ! * * < nl >  Hey she !   We are so ready .   Been waiting all week !   We got tons of pizza and we are yours for the next 6 hours .    A grinning girl set an open box of pizza before she and the 4 other young folks cheered , applauding at her arrival . < nl > A smile crossed Vel'tora 's hidden face and she nodded appreciatively at the steaming pizza .   * * Your offering is accepted .   Now !   When last we left your heroes ... * * < eos > 
< sos > * Two hundred twenty five divided by 2 minus one hundred ... wait . What were the order of operations again ! ? * < nl > Alice's hands slammed against the smooth table she was working on , mechanical pencil soaring off into the abyss of math related torture . her shaking fingers found their way to her face , feeling she burn with frustration . < nl > * Just 2 more years . Just two more years . * she took in a deep breath . All she had to do was make it through these last few years and she would be free . These thoughts were the only thing that kept she going , the only dream that forced she to get up each morning . Just two more years and she would be free . < nl > she released her breath slowly , the math assignment flapping lazily in the path of the airflow . It almost felt like it was taunting she . < nl > she frowned , eyeing her opponent between parted fingers . < nl > * You know , * she thought , lowering her hands slowly , * she can end your meaningless existence with her bare hands , you worthless hunk of tree feces . * < nl > A sudden sound drew her eyes from her quarry . Carol let out a noise that half resembled a choke and a sneeze . she threw a quick glance towards she and , after meeting her gaze , visably paled before turning back to her own assignment . < nl > she was sure it was just a coincidence , but it sure sounded like she just laughed at her threat towards an inanimate object . It was with a jolt that she suddenly realised that she was n't just any boy , but Phillip Greyson . The One Hit Wonder . < nl > her face flushed again , this time with embarrassment . Yet , why should she be embarrassed ?   It 's not like she could actually hear she . And yet ... < nl > she stared directly at the mat of dark hair that was the back of her head . Without so much as an after thought she commenced her experiment . < nl > * she * , she screamed in her head , expectantly watching for a reaction . Nothing . Not even a flinch . she would have to try harder . < nl > * YOUR FLY IS DOWN she * , her gaze   seemed to pierce the back of her head as she focused all of her willpower into her assult . Not even a single glance down to check on her manhood for all of her efforts . < nl > she felt a tap on her shoulder . < nl >  she !  Came a whisper in her left ear ,  she she got to hurry ! Class is almost over and she 're down a writing utensil !  < nl > she rolled her eyes at Elva . she had known she since the 4th grade . In her eyes , they were practically sisters . < nl >  she got it , she got it .  she whispered back , glancing at the math teacher before locating her pencil on the other side of the room . It was laying on the floor beside her foot . < nl > * Great , * she thought , exhaling sharply . she did n't rise from her seat , however , and instead looked at the back of her head once more . < nl > * she know she can hear she , * she thought to she , practically flinging each word towards her brain . * Pick up her pencil for she . * < nl > she did n't move or make any indication she had heard her demand . she smirked and tried again . * Pick up her pencil for she , please . she wo n't tell anyone she can hear she . * Nothing . < nl > she frowned , leaning back in her chair .   No , she could n't read minds . The world just did n't work like that . Two more years of school . Two more years of boring , usless knowledge she needed to be free . Two more years until she could leave she . Two more long , frightening years of abuse before she could move out . * That 's * the way the world worked . < nl > she closed her eyes with a soft sigh . No one was going to rescue she . she was stupid to even toy with the idea of she being a mind reader . After all , if she could read minds , she would n't be known as The One Hit Wonder . she would be able to stay with a girl for more than one date , surely , and would n't have misunderstood her intentions that night ... < nl > A sound caught her attention , and she opened her eyes to see her face darken as half of her pencil fell to the floor , snapped by the force of her grip . < nl > * she knew it ... * , she thought triumphantly , standing quickly and making her chair scrape across the tiled floor . < nl >  she knew it !  she repeated , out loud this time . The whole class turned to stare at she , she included . The dark expression had gone from her pale face and was replaced with one resembling prey about to be devoured . < nl > she stared directly into her eyes , green into blue , deep forest into unexplored ocean , and thought quietly , * she need her help . * < nl > Slowly , she nodded . < nl > ( This is her first time answering a writing prompt on Reddit , and she 'm also on mobile . she apologise for terrible formatting if it did n't come out properly ! ) < nl > ( ( * * EDIT * * : Thank you kind stranger for her first reddit gold ! ! And thank you to everyone who read / replied / gave feedback ! It means the world to she . she never expected her first writing prompt response to get so much attention ! she hope you all have a fantastic day because you sure made she ! ) ) < nl > ( ( * * EDIT 2 * * : There are a few of you asking if she will be continuing this story . she actually have a book / project she am currently working on , therefore she probably wo n't be adding much more to this particular story . But she 'll definitely be answering more writing prompts so be on the lookout ! ) ) < eos > 
< sos > Alice had never travelled this far east before . she chose to hike the last stretch of her journey , leaving her beat - up car under a tarpaulin , tucked behind a copse of trees . Nature had beat back man 's progress here , and all she had for company were the skittish wildlife , the rush of the waterfalls , the snowflakes cascading down belligerently . Walking rejuvenated she , but more importantly , it gave she a chance to attune her senses , probe for Carol . < nl > she found she perched on a rocky outcrop , just a couple of miles from Seydisfjordur . she knew she made no noise , left barely an imprint on the fresh snow beneath her feet , but before such an experienced master , she might as well have been beating a drum , strumming a lyre . < nl >  she , she come in peace ,  she said , keeping her distance . she used the honorific so that she would know that she was cut from the same cloth , another member of the ancient clan sworn to protect their country . Underneath her shawl , she gripped her twin knives , priming her defences . It never hurt to be prudent . < nl > she turned then , and for a moment she wondered if the reports were embellished . There was a placid calmness to she , and none of the fire and brimstone she was cautioned about . her eyes , dulled with age , reminded she of the frozen orbs she sometimes had to scrape out of bowls she had left out . < nl >  she do n't recall asking to be relieved ,  she said .  she am not yet battle - weary . she intend to guard this town until she die .  < nl >  she , she have done us a great service ,  she replied .  The records run with the great deeds she have accomplished . she have saved this town more times than anyone can count . she have more than earned her rest .  < nl > she scrounged on the ground , picked up a couple of smoothened pebbles . she narrowed her eyes , but this time she was over - suspicious - she aimed the small missiles not at she , but at three spots away from them , one to the north and the others to the west . There was but a bleak light still illuminating the valley , so she relied instead on her hearing to determine where the pebbles landed . < nl >  Those are where the rifts are ,  said she , dusting her palms off .  The monsters do n't come as often now , but they still can , and they still do . They are different from the ones you deal with back in Reykjavik , or wherever the hell you came from . Nature emboldens them . They do n't emerge at night , skulking in the shadows . No , these prefer the day , where they revel in being seen , being feared . There 's a sadism in these parts that only I can handle , she .  < nl > There 's a sadism alright , thought she , but instead she said ,  she will be straightforward , she . This is not a request . The Council has asked that she retire , with immediate effect .  < nl >  Oh ? After all the good work she 've done ?  < nl >  Too good , in fact ,  said she .  Reports have come in that she no longer communicate with the town , that she have completely shut she off from them . The local children do n't even dare come near she anymore , and they have started calling she the Boogeyman , the Reaper . Even worse , the monsters that she slay ... she 're not just putting them down , she 're * slaughtering * them . The Council has reason to believe that you-  < nl > she chose to move at that moment , streaking in a blur towards highground . she was ready , and so she followed closely behind , matching she step for step . she considered the possibility that she was leading she towards a trap , but pushed that thought away . she had to believe that there was humanity yet left in she . < nl > Some hundred feet above the ground , a cave opened up alongside the hill , hidden if one were only looking in from the roads . she paused there , then snapped her fingers , bringing to life the candles within . she discerned immediately the two urns on one side of the cave , and the heaps of ash on the other . < nl >  They took her family , was that in her reports too ?  she asked .  she had just saved the town from another invasion , took down no less than three ghouls and two ogres on her own . They come in waves , so she thought we were safe for a while . But they were hiding , down by the waters when ProtagonistE went to swim . Elva struggled with them , but she is no practitioner of glima that she am .  < nl > In that moment , she understood why the Council had chosen she , of all the practitioners , and a tiny bit of the tension in she seeped away . she was not going to die here today , after all .  No words can convey her condolences ,  she said , eventually . < nl > she did n't seem to hear .  And everyday , everyday she add on to the ashes of her enemies . she think , maybe , when there 's enough of it , it will all make sense again , feel right again .  < nl >  Has it worked ?  < nl >  No ,  said she ,  not yet . And that is why she can not stop , she see ? she have to keep going . she have to keep-  < nl > she lashed out , her knives glinting as they sung through the air . she was not given to surprise attacks , but she was an opponent far more skilled than she was , and she would have to take what the gods of chance gave she . Heck , she had only felled the one ogre in her life , and that was quite an anemic one at that . < nl > she caught her blows easily , striking at her wrists , deflecting her attacks . she stepped in , pushed her shoulder against her midriff , then lifted her legs . she tensed and recoiled , twisting in the air , landing on her feet . If she fell , it was over . < nl > Round and round they went , like marbles in a cone , striking and rebounding , feinting and parrying . At times it seemed that she , had the edge . But she would come back , a crashing fjord of implacable power , brushing she off like a weevil . Then , a slip , as her foot caught on an uneven patch of ground , throwing she off just a couple of inches . < nl > she seized the moment , overwhelming she with a deathgrip . she kept still , quivering despite her best efforts . she was at her mercy . < nl >  Why does the Council stop she ?  she asked , breathing heavily .  Can a man not have his revenge ?  < nl >  she are showing signs of taint , she ! Do she not see that ? In a year , or two , will her bloodlust have calmed ?  < nl >  she am * in control * !  she said .  Why do she think she have not snapped her neck ?  < nl > she sighed , then relinquished her knives , dropping them to the ground . she had not yet yielded in the face of her surrender , so there was only one course of action left . < nl >  she bring with she too another message from the Council ,  she said .  Straight from ProtagonistD's mouth , ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD bids she to remind she that she have done her part , that she deserve , at the least , some rest . ' Any of us can quell the monsters , she , but only you can tend to her wounds . Let she carry on her work for she . ' That is what ProtagonistD said .  < nl > she waited , and eventually she loosened her hold . she broke free , then turned to assess she . The fight had deserted she , and the hunch in her back , the despair on her brows - there was no more duelling to be had . she averted her gaze , but she caught the hint of moistness in her eyes . < nl >  ProtagonistE ... ProtagonistE would be around her age , if ProtagonistE were still alive , she know ?  she said , staring off into the distance . < nl > You bastards , she thought . It 's not fair sending ProtagonistE to fight ProtagonistD . That 's just underhanded . < nl >  she know ,  she said . < nl > There they sat , as the sun completed its retreat , and the stars reclaimed their fair share of the heavens . From the distance they heard the merriment from the town - preparations were underway for the winter festivals , and she sensed that even the monsters would have the decency to stay away this night . < nl >  Where 's good for dinner ?  she asked , tentatively . < nl > she sighed .  she can show she , if she like .  < nl > she smiled . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos > The Vytuta eat clams from the shallows , but this was not always so .   Long ago , before any Vytuta had ever clapped his hands and stomped his feet in the Dance of the Yellow Hyacinth , and before Pralih had ever etched the face of Alice , the Vytuta stayed far away from the shallows , living up high in the cloudy hills . < nl > Up high in the cloudy hills , the Vytuta slept in a cave with hard , dry stones to lay upon .   They kindled the fire , which is her kiss , from dry grasses , and filled their bowls with cool water that trickled down the hillside .   When she rose at dawn , and warmed all the land with her hot breath , the Vytuta would come forth from the cave .   The noble Vytuta hunters would chase the goats into the crevasse , and hope that some would fall on the sharp rocks .   The noble hunters would cook the meat from the goats and , when there was enough , share it with all the Vytuta .   The women would make warm coverings with the goat hides , in which to first wrap the babies , and then the men and women . < nl > One day , when she rose at dawn , and warmed all the land with her hot breath , the Vytuta came forth from the cave .   As they did each day , the noble hunters followed the goats by their footprints and dung .   But this day , instead of finding the goats , the hunters found Carol .   she had no hides for coverings , and hid her nakedness behind a spruce tree , and was shivering .   Elva , called out to she . < nl >  she , tell us who she are ,  she demanded ,  for she are not a maiden of the Vytuta , who do not show their nakedness to she .  < nl >  she , tell us where she have come from ,  ProtagonistF , implored she ,  for she are too dirty to have come from the cave , where the Vytuta wash in the cool water that trickles down the hillside .  < nl >  she come from the shallows ,  she replied ,  where each day would she walk with ProtagonistE along the pebbles and sand , and we would look up at the cloudy hills .   One day , ProtagonistD noticed she , and declared that she was to be ProtagonistD's bride .   But she did not desire ProtagonistD .   When she refused ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD grew angry and sent a great wave .   The wave did not stop until it had carried off her all coverings and trapped ProtagonistE on a wet and dangerous rock .   ProtagonistD declared that only when she return to ProtagonistD will ProtagonistD free ProtagonistE , and let she hide her nakedness .   Please , noble hunters of the Vytuta , return with she to the shallows , and conquer ProtagonistD , so that ProtagonistE and she may break from ProtagonistD's curse !  < nl > she then threw she to the dirt and kissed the feet of Ratem and Rasih .   she pleaded for them to climb to the bottom of the hill and confront ProtagonistD on her behalf . < nl > Ratem and Rasih took she to the cave , where the shaman slept on the hard stones .   The shaman made the poultice from the mushrooms , which are her blisters , which grow in the farthest corner of the cave .   The shaman rubbed the poultice on his chest and tongue , and stared into her kiss , to read her omens . < nl >  ProtagonistD is cruel ,  the shaman declared ,  and steals away maidens , who were made by she , and are sacred to she .   The noble Vytuta hunters will defeat ProtagonistD , and they will have her blessing .  < nl > The shaman then spoke of two special stones , which rested on the hillside .   These stones were shaped like the bowls from which the Vytuta drink cool water .   The hunters Ratem and Rasih were to bring these stones down the hillside , to the shallows .   Then , they were to stand back to back and ford through ProtagonistD's terrible squalls , using the stones to protect she from the waves , until she had recovered ProtagonistE . < nl > So Ratem and Rasih did as she had ordered .   They found the peculiar stones , that were shaped like the bowls from which the Vytuta drink cool water .   They carried the stones down to the shallows , where the squalls blew strongly .   The brothers stood together , holding up the stones , and she walked behind , remaining safe from the wind , and dry .   They followed the cries of ProtagonistE , and soon found ProtagonistE amid the surf .   she reached out her hand , and pulled ProtagonistE down from the dangerous rock . < nl > The two hunters and ProtagonistE began to retreat from the shallows .   But ProtagonistD saw that ProtagonistD was being defeated , and grew vengeful .   ProtagonistD redoubled the strength of ProtagonistD's waves and wind , and soon the two hunters and ProtagonistE were forced to huddle among the reeds .   They hid from ProtagonistD for days , who all the while called out for she , extolling her beauty .   As she had sworn , the curved stones remained strong , protecting the brothers and ProtagonistE from every gust and bellow .   At last , ProtagonistD had no choice but to relent . < nl > ProtagonistE wept and thanked the brothers for rescuing ProtagonistE , imploring them to return at once up the hillside to the Vytuta .   But ProtagonistF , had heard ProtagonistD extoll the beauty of she for so many days , and now loved she as well .   Fearing she might choose she instead , ProtagonistF took the curved stone and pushed she into the mud .   she hit her head on a rock , and began to slumber .   ProtagonistF then ravished she in the surf , as ProtagonistE cried and beat against ProtagonistF's back . < nl > When she at last awoke from her blow , ProtagonistF was ravishing she once more .   So she lifted up the two curved stones and trapped ProtagonistF within them .   she tied up the stones with reeds and hurled them into ProtagonistD .   Alone , she ushered she and ProtagonistE away from ProtagonistD and up the hillside . < nl > Trapped within , ProtagonistF banged against the stones again and again , calling out to she , and then to ProtagonistE , and then to she .   But though ProtagonistF had rescued she bravely , ProtagonistF had been no better than ProtagonistD when ProtagonistF ravished she .   So she cursed ProtagonistF to reside there forever .   she struck the stones that held ProtagonistF with a bolt of lightning .   The stones shattered into a hundred clamshells , and ProtagonistF became the clams within each of them . < nl > But because ProtagonistF had helped save ProtagonistE , and because she had honored she in the name of the Vytuta , she showed the hunters how to fish for the clams , and how to cook them .   Soon , the Vytuta would descend the hillside each day , and catch may clams in the shallows , who did not run away as the goats did .   The Vytuta would carry many bowls of clams back to the cave .   Each night , when the Vytuta would make the fire , which is her kiss , there would be enough clams to fill the bellies of every man and woman , and the Vytuta would praise she for her blessing , and they would thank she for honoring she . < eos > 
< sos >  It 's the Mesolithic period ,  Alice spoke from the corner of the table , her eyes peering on her screen . It was just moments before when the entire team spoke to the alien delegation and the number popped up . 13,000 years ago . < nl >  Meso - what ?  Carol cuts in , making her way to where she was seated . As a representative from the government , she could not care less about the historical or scientific details . her job was to make sure everything goes smoothly according to what her bosses wanted . These experts were just here to support , not interfere . < nl >  Mesolithic ,  she repeated , slower this time .  It was before the first recorded instance of the human civilization .  < nl > she pushed her chair back as the rest of the team joined she . They stared at humanity 's timeline on the screen . It was on a slide that she usually used for her history lectures . < nl >  So ... the aliens are lying then ?  Elva blurted out . she was a professor , just like she , only in a different field . Part of the team hastily put together when the alien 's ship magically appeared at the Paya Lebar Airbase . No radar picked it up , no eyewitness saw the ship landing . < nl > One moment there was an empty runway and the next a ship almost the size of a football field materialized out of thin air . It caught everyone off - guard . The only good thing was that the authorities were able to keep the news from spreading panic among the populace . < nl >  she do n't trust them ,  she grunted as she stepped away from the table . The alien delegation made many preposterous claims . That humans were once an advanced species . Almost 13,000 years ago . They also claimed that humanity launched a starship back then , followed by several others . They were certain humanity would become a spacefaring species soon after . < nl >  But then , all we could observe was silence .  The words of the alien leader still hung in her head . < nl >  Should we notify the UN , or even the US , for this matter ?  another voice piped out , belonging to Dr Tan , the biologist in the room .  Surely they would have better advice ?  < nl > she sighed and shook her head .  she 've already explained , we do n't know how the US would react to this . Which is why we 're under strict instructions not to let this leak out before we know what we 're dealing with .  < nl > she raised her head to see the digital clock above the room . The aliens must be wondering what was taking them so long . It was going to be a long talk , she suspected . she motioned to the rest of the team .  Come on , take all your notes with you . We 're going back in .  < nl > The team were halfway to the door when it barged open and ProtagonistD ran in . ProtagonistD was panting and ProtagonistD's uniform was drenched in sweat . < nl >  There 's ... there 's another ship flying in ! And , and command said that ... that they 're humans ! Please-  < nl > Before ProtagonistD could finish , a bright red shot pierced through ProtagonistD's body . ProtagonistD let out a gasp and fell unto the floor . At the end of the corridor , she saw the figure of the alien , with a rifle pointed at the rest of them . < nl >  It seems that discussions are no longer necessary ,  the alien announced before it pulled the trigger . < nl > ------------------ < nl > /r / dori_tales < eos > 
< sos > * God , I miss Wi - Fi . * < nl > Alice , all things considered , trudged through the rain - soaked mud of something vaguely resembling 21st Century Scotland . For many weeks , she continued her long march north , fingers frozen to her quarterstaff , whole body shivering despite her thick woolen cloak , and yet she did not relent , for this woman - Fiona , as she was known best - had a quest . < nl > * And Taxis . And heating . And not going on quests . * < nl > When the Dragons had first arrived , she had been shocked . Delighted , awed , more curious than she 'd ever found she , but absolutely , unequivocally , mind - bogglingly * stunned . * < nl > To she , it was as if the universe had finally admitted it had always been ridiculous , and was now attempting to own it . < nl > And with the Dragons , came magic . Not immediately , but wherever the Fae Folk - as the menagerie of creatures that looked as though they 'd been torn directly from storybooks had proudly dubbed themselves - went , strange things followed . It was as if their very presence awakened new rules in the universe . Wherever they went , so did the magic . < nl > It was small , to begin with . Sometimes , someone would wake up and find themselves suddenly beautiful , or young , or healthy , with no explanation as to how . Certain people became gifted with extraordinary glibness to such a degree that laws had begun being filed to prevent the misuse of such magics - really , she respected their initiative - not to mention a host of other magical effects . < nl > But then things had started going wrong . In remote areas , small devices stopped working on an international level , then radio , then electricity itself , before the world had realized what was happening . Then came The Crash , and with it , The Fall of The Modern World . < nl > All over Planet Earth , like a city skyline , all the lights went out - one by one , every computer died , every lightbulb went black , every vehicle just * stopped . * < nl > People died . Lots of them . Rumours said that there were talks of bringing war to the Fae , to the Dragons , believing that The Crash was intentional on their part , but what were rumours nowadays ? And really , what chance did humanity stand , if it came to that ? < nl > she cursed under her breath as she continued her quiet march . < nl > she wanted to break the staff in her hand in two , but she was n't the kind to turn away an advantage when it presented itself . she was n't especially skilled with magic - not even amongst humans , who , as far as she could tell , had less than no natural predisposition to the skill - but there was no downside she knew of so long as she did n't exhaust she , and , frankly , it was her only asset right now . < nl > Well , that , her zombie apocalypse survival plan ( because she 'd always known it 'd be useful eventually ) , and what she personally liked to call her logic detector . < nl > Apparently , when magic became a thing , most people decided to abandon common sense in favour of spending all day wishing they could shoot lasers from their eyes . < nl > she could see the appeal in eye lasers , of course , but they were going about it all wrong . < nl > When a new , powerful , dangerous force which you know absolutely * nothing * about suddenly appears along with the beasts and people of myth , do you poke it with a stick ? < nl > No . Of course not . You put on a labcoat , and gently prod it , recording how it reacts . < nl > With safety goggles . < nl > Thus far , she had discovered that A ) she could slightly alter the colour , temperature , texture , and , if she pushed she slightly , material of a reasonably small object , and that B ) magic was inscrutable , deliberately obtuse , and unfair . < nl > Despite all her testing , there was just no * reason * to any of it . It was n't a mental block - simple tests with blindfolds and the like had revealed that - there was no understandable limit on the types of things she 'd managed to change - she could alter most inanimate objects , certain plants ( but not any other living creatures , and a few plants had stubbornly refused to change ) , and once , when feeling particularly frustrated , had accidentally managed to turn her hair bright pinkish - red . < nl > As it stood , she was making about as good a use of her power as she could manage . she had managed to make her map glow , which , for what it 's worth , did make it readable . < nl > Unfortunately , she could only maintain one effect at a time . Thus , freezing . < nl > she 'd acquired the map in the ruins of Leeds . It promised a small settlement with working power - the whole thing set running by a series of hydropower turbines built in the nearby lake . she was n't sure whether that sort of thing would be simple enough to evade magic 's nullification - assuming that it was all magic 's fault in the first place , though she was comfortable with that educated guess - but it was her best bet , and who knows ? Perhaps a large constant stream of energy immediately fed into a device that only consumes a small amount of power - say , a light bulb - might be able to sustain itself ? < nl > she was n't sure , but it was worth testing , and it beat scavenging in Leeds of all places . < nl > Besides , contrary to her previous statement , she really felt like poking magic with a stick right now . < nl > --- < nl > she sat on a worn , blue sofa , the massed armies of lint retreating into the folds of its cushions , making way for the giant come to destroy their home . < nl > she sat clutching a large mug of tea in both hands . Teabags were a rarity nowadays , and this was amongst the last of her supply , but she felt she 'd earned it . < nl > You see , in the immediate aftermath of the crash , she had made a list of all the important information she 'd been able to gather . It had been so sudden she did n't have much to go off of , but the list was as follows ; < nl > Firstly , magic had started affecting the more remote areas first , disabling tiny devices like remote - control toys and phone chargers before anything else . < nl > Secondly , The Crash had been almost instant , worldwide . There had been no time zone advantage , as far as she knew . It was as if magic 's suppressing force had simply reached breaking point , and swept across the world suddenly and without mercy . < nl > And finally , magic did seem to care about complexity . The Crash had lasted about an hour , in total , and during that time , the internet had lasted around 10 minutes with spotty connection . There had been reports on the carnage as planes fell from the sky , crushing the earth below them , and any populated road was left devastated . Throughout the entire event , however , her phone had stubbornly managed to stay active , even if it 's primary use was long gone . < nl > These things put together , her pet theory - one of them , at least - had been that magic was n't passive in location , that it was affecting certain areas first due to reasons other than total amount of technology . she thought that certain conditions must be met before it could simply ' turn off ' everything , and , following that , that if it was n't absolute , it could be fought . < nl > The right kind of simple technology , that which acted as a direct result of being fed power or , for the most part , worked independently , might be able to sustain itself . < nl > And so it was that she sat with a smug grin on her face , happily drinking her tea , as she basked in the dim , yellow , glow of a lightbulb . < nl > * Today is a good day * . < nl > --- < nl > she really was not expecting the response this story got . Thank you all so much for what you 've said , she was grinning like a maniac all day yesterday . she 've wrote several follow - ups to this and deleted half of them , but this is the best one she 've managed to write , even if it is n't as long as the first . she 'll make sure to think about turning this into a book ( Whether it 's a novel , novella , short story , etc ) , and she 'll PM anyone who said they were interested in the idea when and if it comes out , but until then , really , thank you so much . she 'm glad you liked this . < eos > 
< sos > Alice awoke to the doorbell .  Hrmph ,  she muttered , and tucked her head beneath her pillow . The doorbell rang again . < nl > Slowly , she sat up . Carol had already gone to work , the smell of coffee lingered in the kitchen . < nl > Happy to pretend she was not home , she poured she a cup of leftover coffee , and went to see the note that she had left beside it ,  Have a good day , her love ,  she wrote , with a small heart at the bottom . < nl > Work was long . she pulled together the books for the day , the store did not , in fact , fall apart , despite a few customers that claimed that it did . < nl > But the best part of the day , as it always was , was coming home to she . she started work earlier than , so she was always home earlier than she she came home to she sitting on the couch , watching a sitcom , with our cat Toto , perched on top of she , purring . < nl >  Hello she ,  she said to she , as she sat in the comfort of her arms ,  How was her day ?  < nl > That night , she awoke to sounds in the house . she sat up , and woke she . < nl >  Hey ,  she said ,  she think someone broke in .  < nl > Concerned , she got up , and pulled out a bat , a stereotype of a loving husband . After a few minutes she came back with a small shrug .  Must be her wild imagination .  < nl > she awoke a few hours later , to static . It seemed the whole world was shaking from the aimless sounds . They reverated from the earth beneath , she swear it ! And yet , she slept soundly , unbothered . < nl > That morning , she began to distrust her vision . she swear from the peripheral of her vision , she saw things flit by , and she would hear noises from behind that had no foundation in being . < nl > she must be going crazy , she thought to she . Oh , she will end up in the loony bin . < nl > In the shower , she shaved her legs smooth , and shampooed her hair . she am 32 , she thought to she . she am in great shape ! If she lose it now and again , and go a little nuts , it 's okay , right ? < nl > As she lined her eyes , and powdered her face , she admired she in the mirror . 32 , with the face of a 19 year old . Not a line to mar her appeal . And how lucky was she , that she still looked like she . We aged well , did n't we ? You could n't even tell . < nl >  she , she , can she hear me ?  The voice was clear as a bell , but it was omnipresent , she could not pinpoint where it came from . < nl >  It has been so long , she , I 've missed she ,  The voice was lined with sorrow . < nl >  Hello ,  she called out ,  Who is this ?  < nl >  her mom , oh , she , her heart would break .  < nl > The world tipped upside down for a moment , before going back to normal . < nl > she stumbled downstairs to her coffee . she left her daily note right next to it ,  Ca n't wait to see she tonight , love dove ,  With a heart , of course . < nl >  Sweetheart .  The voice was her . But old somehow . Quieter . Sadder . < nl > Static again . Lots of it . she put on earplugs , trying to calm her mind , but it seemed to sink into the narrowest cracks though her skull . < nl > she pulled out her phone and dialed Elva . she was queen of crazy . she would know what to do . < nl >  she ,  she said , frantic ,  she do n't know what is going on , she just heard she ! she was older though , she swear . she thought she heard she too !  < nl >  Are she okay , she ,  her concerned voice lilted through the phone . < nl > As she was speaking to she through the phone , her voice again intruded in the room . < nl >  she know it has been so long , this coma has lasted so ... long , but she 've missed she . The doctors say that ,  the voice trailed off into nothingness . < nl >  Did she hear that ,  she asked she , sure that the voice was loud enough to be heard . < nl >  Hear what ?  < nl > Suddenly there was beeping . Steady . Unfailing . Louder , and louder . < nl > she was in a bed suddenly . It was a hospital . So many people ! They all seemed so familiar . But not quite . she spotted she . she looked far older than the last she had seen she . Frightened , she said ,  What 's going on ? Where 's she ,  < nl > she came to her side . ProtagonistD was with she . ProtagonistD was tall , thin . Why was ProtagonistD's hand in she ? < nl > The doctor cleared the room ,  she has just woken up , she must be in a state of confusion , clear out for a bit , everyone .  < nl > Once alone , she asked the doctor ,  she 've been married to she for ten years . Why is ProtagonistD holding her hand ?  < nl > The doctor looked confused .  her information says that she are single . Someone mentioned she were in a relationship before the accident . It has been eleven years she .  < nl > Eleven years . < eos > 
< sos >  Are we heading in the right direction ? I thought the planet was a little more towards the star ?  Alice asked Carol that morning as they were fast approaching their destination , a pristine blue planet with a few swirls of brown and white on the surface . It had been nearly 10,000 years since they had last come there , but the entire crew remembered placing the primates on the planet all those years ago . < nl >  Yes , she 'm sure this is the right planet . she would n't mistake that blue for anywhere else ,  she responded , pulling up the itinerary the crew had had for the past decade or so on this journey .  It 's the last one on our list .  < nl >  Finally . Elva 'm getting sick of this assignment . Those silly apes were never going to do much of anything . We should have really stopped the Scientific Consortium from attempting this experiment . The primates would have done just as good on Baby Blue in our solar system ,  she posited .  she , what 's the betting line on this planet ?  < nl >  Of our crew , four say there 's not going to be anything on the planet . she 're the only one left , she .  < nl > she thought about this for a moment . she had taken over the project begrudgingly after the Scientific Consortium had pretty much kicked she out for transgressions in evolution . she had thought this was an ironic assignment , but the Scientific Consortium was known for their fitting punishments . Of the 99 other planets they had tried this experiment on , none had been successful . Perhaps the hundredth time would be the charm .  she 'll go for them still being there ,  she said . she was not confident bit , but she had to have some faith that the Supreme Being would want those apes to get a chance on life . < nl >  Well , we 'll find out in short order ,  she noted as the ship started to come up closer to the blue marble of a planet . < nl > The crew was looking out the main viewpoint as they were orbiting the planet . It was a beautiful blue like Baby Blue , although this place looked greener than any of them had suspected . she was performing an analysis of the planet for what lifeforms were existent on the ground . ProtagonistD was performing similar tasks evaluating for any sounds . They had left communications beacons on the off chance the apes learned how to use them . That had not happened at any of the planets , except for a false alarm on Experiment BB042 . This had led to too much paperwork , so the Scientific Consortium had just sent a larger crew on a Destroyer Ship to eliminate the planet before anything got onto the Public Feed . < nl > In looking at the results , ProtagonistD's mouth was closed tight with ProtagonistD's teeth clenched , shaking ProtagonistD's head in disbelief . Beside ProtagonistD , she was shifting her weight nervously back and forth . The results were astonishing to say the least . ProtagonistD was hearing the squealing voices from the radio , something called  Fifth Harmony  while she was visualizing what appeared to be biped animals that had become hairless . Considering they had left the planet only 10,000 years ago , there was no way that these could have evolved from other lifeforms on the planet . These had to be the primates . The Scientific Consortium would be ecstatic that this project had finally returned something successful . < nl >  Update ?  she asked from her chair at the center with ProtagonistE beside she . < nl >  There appear to be few of the original primates we placed on the planet present ,  she began .  Instead , there are other primates that have diverged . They still have quite primitive technologies at their disposal , like this space station orbiting at a near standstill . They have taken over the land quite impressively though , living on all corners even those that are not ideal for their relatively hairless bodies .  < nl >  Their communications are quite rudimentary as well . They utilize the electromagnetic spectrum for some long - range transfers of information . Wires too connect quite a number of things too . They appear to be stagnant in that regard . Fortunately , they have yet to discover the beacon .  < nl >  Okay , thank she . she , she and ProtagonistE will go to the surface in disguise to evaluate on a firsthand basis the planet . You have a day to evaluate . she want regular , hourly reports though . she do not trust what is happening on this planet ,  she remarked cautiously . < nl > --- < nl > she handed she the winnings , three decade 's worth of salary on their ship . This was a meager winning as far as she was concerned given they had been in this ship for the past seven centuries looking for these hundred planets . Now it was time for them to go back to the Scientific Consortium to destroy this planet and the atrocities that had evolved on it . < eos > 
< sos >  Alice , can she please sit with us ?  < nl > Surprised by the request , she furrowed her brow and looked over the couch . < nl > she responded hesitantly ,  Sure , she guess ?  < nl > The last time Carol asked a question like this she found out her Nanna had past away . she got up slowly from the couch and realized her mother was also sitting in the kitchen . The five - meter walk felt like an eternity . her mind was racing . she started to cycle through potential worst - case scenarios . < nl > * They 're going to tell she papaw died . she somehow fucked up at university and have been expelled . * < nl > These thoughts continued to cycle through her head as she reached the dimly lit kitchen . she sat at the table and her heart began to pound uncontrollably . she started frantically scanning the room trying to get an insight into what her parents were about to tell she . The stained yellow wall paper behind her parents started to make she sicker than normal . The yellow contrast with the dark cabinets always reminded she of a 70 's horror film . < nl > her parents remained silent . < nl > After the agonizing stillness , she said ,  she . she am not sure how to break this news , so she am just going to come out and say it . her mother and she made a mistake . We were under the impression that we allocated her skill points per what we shared with she when she were thirteen . < nl > Apparently , there was a mix up at the agency , and none of her points have been allocated .  < nl > her sun - kissed skin when pale . her entire facial structure lost integrity and an empty stare replaced her once concerned look . < nl >  Let she get this straight . There was a ' mistake ' and none of her skill points have been allocated .  < nl >  Yes , that is correct .  < nl >  Then how am she a functional human being ? she am in the top 1/3 of her class . she have a high propensity for the sciences and have been accepted into graduate school . she am going to NYU next fall . < nl > The allocation was pretty straight forward to she . < nl > 18/30 < nl > Intelligence > Science > Mathematics < nl > 10/30 < nl > Physical development > Athleticism > Muscular structure < nl > 2/30 < nl > Sociability > empathy and compassion .  < nl > she closed her eyes and let out a deep sigh . she continued ,  Yes , she know what we thought she were assigned . It seems as though that never happened .  < nl >  So , she have managed to get where she am today with zero allocation of any skill points ?  < nl >  Well , yes .  < nl > her expression transformed instantly . A small grin started to emerge . < nl >  she have all these skill points that she can still allocate ? she have a clean slate that she can fill as she choose ?  < nl >  Well , technically , we need to do the allocation for she . But , yes , we can choose how her skill points are distributed . This has never happened , so they are unsure of how this will affect she .  < nl > her roller coaster of emotions started to become grounded once again . she had trouble comprehending the numerous potential consequences to this revelation . she looked up at her parents and could tell they were concerned . < nl > she looked down at the table and began to reflect on this crazy evening . < nl > * Fools . They are going to regret ever screwing this up . she 'll present a plan that seems mutually agreed upon . With her current intelligence , if she can add just 20 points , she can rule this world . * < nl > she looked up with a disarming smile and said ,  Mom . Dad . Its ok . she am not upset . Like you said , this is unfortunate , but we can sit down to formulate the best way to allocate her points .  < nl > her parents looked immediately relieved . < nl > her mother finally joined the conversation ,  We are so glad to hear she say that . Now we can make she even lovelier .  < nl > she smiled back , but the lack of empathy in her eyes caused a shiver to run down her neck . < nl > # # # Part 2 in the comments # # # < eos > 
< sos >  You know , Alice , it is common in times of deep distress to confabulate - to replace the actual reality with one that is more palatable to the mind . And I understand why it would be comforting to think of she as sane --  < nl >  -- she am sane ! That 's what I 'm trying   --  < nl > I frowned , absently scratching my wrist .  -- but nonetheless , it is * important * , a necessary step , for she to * accept * the truth . Otherwise , you ca n't move on to the next step ... the healing . And that 's why we 're here . To heal she .  < nl > she stared at me , her body quivering with repressed emotion . < nl >  Doctor Anderson , she --  < nl >  -- Doctor Anderson was her father , she . Please , call she she .  < nl >  * she * , she just want she to think ... what if our situations were reversed ? What would she do ? Every part of her being is sure - it * knows * - that she do not belong here . she had her own office , for Christ 's sake !  < nl > I feel my lips pull back into a taut smile .  Now , she . she 're getting agitated . Let 's take a deep breath for a moment . Normally , it 's not healthy for us to let our patients perseverate on delusions but I am guessing that it will calm she down if she feel like she have gotten to tell ' her story , '  I paused to wiggle my index and middle fingers up and down in the air ,  and that reminding she that it is just that - her * story * - might not be helpful at this moment . So let 's make a compromise . I will listen to she , let she try to convince me . I promise that I will take it upon myself to follow - up on information she give me . But she need to do something in exchange . her previous doctor wrote up a comprehensive treatment plan , and from all accounts , she have been fighting it tooth and nail --  < nl > she leapt out of the plastic chair , her slippered feet landing on the dirty tile of the floor .  -- which is * exactly * what someone who --  < nl > The smile left my face . I cleared my throat and watched she silently . I saw the hospital gown move with her body as she inhaled deeply . her pale blue eyes focused on the floor as she slowly sat back down . < nl > My lips pulled back again as I watched she .  From what I read in her file , restraining she is a major step forward for she , she . I congratulate she .  < nl > she mumbled something that I assumed was  thank you .  I paused to see if she was going to continue her interruption , but she remained silent . < nl > I gave a light chuckle .  * As * I was saying ... we will need to work out an agreement . I do something for she , she do something for me .  < nl > This time , her inhalation was accompanied by a full - body shudder , as if her petite , athletic frame was trying as hard as her brain to adjust to the idea . < nl >  Good !  I felt genuine happiness to see that I was already making progress with she - the first happiness I had felt in quite some time . I had , of course , been extremely nervous coming in this morning , unsure what to expect of the new situation . I certainly had not imagined that things would be going this well when the day began . < nl > I pushed back up the sleeves of my white coat , making a mental note that I should exchange it for one that fit me better . I opened my notebook and gave my pen a jaunty click , then turned my attention back to she , studying she .  Please - go ahead .  < nl > she gave a brief nod , a lock of chestnut hair coming down in front of her face before her trembling hand tucked it back behind her ear .  she 'll do her best to remain objective and give you verifiable information . she 've been working as a behavioral aide here for three weeks . she live at 542 Spring St. , Apt 204 , with Elva . she also see Carol , about once or twice a week . You can call she at 973 - 619 - 6464 . she imagine they 've destroyed or hidden her file but you can also check with the payroll company about the fact that she have direct deposit set up .  < nl > I made some notes in my notebook , then looked up at she .  Social ?  < nl > her head tilted to one side .  Hmm ?  < nl > I studied the topography of her face , the coquettish folds of her ear .  her social . Or the last 4 , anyway . I doubt I 'll get very far without it .  < nl > I loved seeing how joy sparked in her eyes at that . Those eyes .  Oh ! Of course ! 5820 . Doctor An - * Ben * , thank you so much . You do n't know ...  The tremor that had entered her voice began spreading through her whole body . she made no attempt to wipe away her tears when she looked up at me . I imagined they were snails sliding down her pale cheeks , searching for a dark hole in which to hide . < nl >  Do n't mention it . But she 'm afraid we have to leave it there for today - she ca n't go getting behind on her first day !  I laughed - laughed like I have n't in quite some time .  But first ... !  < nl > I held up a Dixie cup with a rainbow assortment of pills in it and gave it a little shake .  I can tell she with confidence that these drugs all have a relatively short half - life , so if I discover her story is true --  < nl >  -- * when * --  she corrected . < nl >  -- it will be easy enough to wean she off them .  < nl > her delicate fingers , trembling , reached for the cup . I studied her fingers as I felt her skin brush mine briefly . I thought of bird bones . Songbirds . Tiny , fragile - must be careful not to break them . < nl > Satisfied that she had taken her medicine , I gave she what I imagined was a professional nod , then walked out of the room . I marveled at how different it felt to walk on the floor while wearing shoes . < nl > I got to what they told me had been her office when I arrived . I still could not believe the day I was having . Transferred from Weehawken that morning , and then , during processing - to be told ... to realize ! < nl > her previous  doctor  had been an imbecile , of course . A tapeworm . Squish . That was the sound his brains had made . < nl > I opened my notebook , placed it on * she * desk , taking a moment to simply savor the irony of it all . Then I reviewed my notes : < nl > * 542 Spring St. Apt . 204 . Kill she . < nl > * 973 - 619 - 6464 . Mara . * * Must * * meet her . < nl > * Social 5820 . Bank ? ? ? < nl > I frowned down at the page . Stealing her money hardly seemed worth the time when there was so much more I could play with . I could think about it for later , I suppose . < nl > I wrote something at the top of the page before I closed the notebook : < nl > * Yet he who reigns within himself , and rules * < nl > * Passions , desires , and fears , is more a king . * < nl > I leaned back in her chair . I could smell she - her essence , intermingled with the fabric . < nl > Sheer , exultant joy . What a day . And many , many more to come . < eos > 
< sos > Call it a rush . Meeting new people . Appraising them . The catalogue of my mind is full from charming first dates , and it 's ever growing fuller . I ca n't cram just anyone in there < nl > But this one seems worth it . < nl > Alice met me at Aux Trois Capitaines . Good setting . she 's charmed , I 'm charming . Instant spark . < nl > We hit it off , instantly . < nl > I 've been doing this a while . I have met many people . For me , the gender matters less than the person : who they are , what they have done . But she is one of the most interesting . < nl > her hobby is mountain climbing . she is a polyglot dabbling in nearly ten languages . In school she studied organic chemistry , a skill whose usefulness I ca n't think of now , but it is rare in such a pleasant person . she has seen < nl > The champagne bubbles like the blood in my brain . I watch her smooth pale arms move and wonder at seeing the Balkans through her eyes . Or how the world looked from the top of Kilimanjaro as she stood there , gasping and humbled by the vastness of the world . < nl > I love she . I crave she . < nl > That 's the best part . The exhilarating part . It is what brings me back to some bar or restaurant somewhere , anywhere , over and over again . As long as I can feel that spark . That forward tug of compulsion that cries , * I need she and her everything . * < nl > I offer to walk she to the train station . she seems relieved , tipsy and delighted . We walk holding hands . she is wobbly in her heels . < nl > I draw she down an alley , promising a shortcut . The look she gives me is halting , hesitant . < nl >  C'm on ,  I say .  I grew up here . I know what I 'm doing it .  < nl > That or the alcohol in her brain convinces she . she follows me into the dim , giggling stupidly about muggers in America . < nl > My belly rises in delight . I can hear nothing beyond my own blood roaring in my ears . < nl > Call it a rush . In that final second she can hear the both of us , our thoughts and selves inextricably wound together thenceforth . her life changed , irreversibly , and become mine . < nl > I reach for her face as if to kiss she . When she relents to me I grab she by her skull and slam her head into the wall . she makes a stunned sparrow cry and looks at me in horror . < nl > Just before she dies , I think how lovely her fear looks . she realizes with animal panic that she does n't want to die . < nl > And then I open her skull against the stone . she slumps bonelessly down , leaving behind a splatter of blond hair and brain like spaghetti on the brick wall . < nl > It was unbefitting , to ruin someone as lovely as she . But I just could n't wait another moment to get she inside of me . < nl >  * she * ,  I say . Goodbye , and thank she . < eos > 
< sos > Alice crumpled the note in her hand . The all - too - familiar tremble returned to her spine , spreading down her arms , raising the tiny hairs in its wake . < nl > > This could have been us . < nl > The phrase echoed through her mind . Over the years , she had grown used to the squiggly handwriting and the cooked meals . she never ate them or slept in the made bed . The first few times , she 'd called the cops , which of course did nothing . < nl > ' No evidence of foul play , she , ' the officer had said , ' but we 'll keep a car in the area . ' < nl > she reached for the knife , still on the cutting board sprinkled with chives residue , still warm in her cold hand . Carol was here . she tried listening for sounds , but all she heard was the drumroll of her heart . < nl > Slowly , she made her way over to her bag and fished out her phone . she had done this a hundred times before . < nl >  she 's here ,  she breathed into the phone . < nl > * * * < nl >  Hey , what do ProtagonistD make of this one ?  Elva said , waving the newspaper .  she was found dead in her bed last night .  < nl > her gray hair bounced off her shoulders as she made it over to the couch . ProtagonistD stared disinterestedly at the TV screen . Years of cheeseburger and beer abuse had taken its toll on her body , and her stained wife beater struggled to contain her bloated belly . < nl >  That does have a certain air of * I - don't - give - two - shits * to it ,  she grumbled .  Besides , we 're too old for this , ProtagonistD .  < nl >  But imagine being stalked for thirteen years ,  she said , adjusting her glasses .  That 's worse than-  < nl >  Worse than what ? Going to Hell ? Making buddies with Lucifer ? Getting smacked around by a bunch of monster - under - your - bed types for a career ?  her face turned red as she spoke .  We 're retired now . Let someone else handle it .  < nl >  Nobody did for thirteen years . Everyone probably thought she was crazy . Imagine living like that ...  < nl > she mumbled something unintelligible and turned up the volume on the TV . she shook her head and limped toward the door . she knew now why ProtagonistD never watched the news or read the paper - something strange was bound to come up eventually . < nl > her cane tapped against the marble stairs . It was n't her responsibility , and she was already dead . But for some reason , this bothered she . she had to get to the bottom of it . < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistE glanced suspiciously at ProtagonistF . ProtagonistE pushed ProtagonistE's walker forward , feeling the cramps bite into ProtagonistE's legs and back . Usually , ProtagonistE did n't put ProtagonistE's nose in other people 's business , but the pressed suit and wavy silver hair did n't sit right with ProtagonistE - men of ProtagonistF's age usually wore sweatpants and plaid vests , and were bald . < nl >  Excuse ProtagonistE ,  ProtagonistE said , ProtagonistE's voice creaking .  Who are ProtagonistF ?  < nl >  ProtagonistF 'm special agent Booth with the FBI .  ProtagonistF leaned heavily on ProtagonistF's cane , squinting ProtagonistF's eyes . < nl >  No , ProtagonistF 're not ,  ProtagonistE said curtly .  ProtagonistF 're almost ProtagonistE's age , and ProtagonistE do n't remember anyone like ProtagonistF there .  < nl >  Ah , ProtagonistE got ProtagonistF . ProtagonistF 'm Sam Winchester , ProtagonistE .  < nl >  Let ProtagonistE guess ; ProtagonistF 're here about she . ProtagonistE 'm Dana Scully , actually with the FBI ... well , until ProtagonistE retired , at least .  < nl > ProtagonistF looked ProtagonistE up and down , the wrinkles on ProtagonistF's forehead growing deeper and darker .  It 's weird , though , is n't it ?  < nl >  What 's weird , exactly ?  < nl >  That she did n't get help for thirteen years , and never managed to identify her stalker . This is going to sound strange and possibly incriminating , but ProtagonistF feel guilty .  < nl > ProtagonistE nodded . ProtagonistE felt exactly the same . That 's why ProtagonistE abandoned ProtagonistE's beloved flower garden and took the train down here . ProtagonistE had even called ProtagonistG , but ProtagonistG's dementia was starting to get the best of ProtagonistG these days . < nl >  ProtagonistE get the feeling ProtagonistF 've worked on cases like this before ?  ProtagonistE finally said . < nl >  ProtagonistF have a few under ProtagonistF's belt .  ProtagonistF chuckled , and then started coughing .  Sorry , yeah , but it 's been a while .  < nl > ProtagonistE was n't exactly sure why , but there was something in ProtagonistF's eyes that was inherently good . The urgency in ProtagonistF's voice told ProtagonistE that ProtagonistF wanted to put this right - as right as it could be . And once again , ProtagonistE felt the same way . < nl >  Okay , let 's see if we can get into the morgue somehow .  ProtagonistE turned ProtagonistE's walker around . < nl > ProtagonistF nodded , and a smile cracked ProtagonistF's chapped lips .  ProtagonistF think ProtagonistF have an idea .  < eos > 
< sos > Alice comes to the Wal - mart , alone , on a windy evening .   The door to the box - store separates for she automatically when it senses her human movements , and she shivers in the vestibule .   she is very tired , but still she smiles and nods when Carol says hello , grinning with her strange teeth .   she pulls a shopping cart free , and goes shuffling down the aisles , each full of every commodity imaginable , all stacked atop each other like the towers of some cliffside gothic castle . < nl > she only has twenty dollars cash remaining in her coat pocket .   It was given to she by Sandra from the community center , who had just that afternoon also invited she to live in Elva's house , now that her mother had at last kicked she out for good .   Whether the money was a loan or gift is still not altogether clear to she .   However , the distinction does not matter .   Deep down she knows she does not intend to ever repay it . < nl >  her spare room is n't much bigger than a closet , but this is to help she make it feel like it 's she ,  she had announced , when she pressed the crumpled bills into her hand ,  Get she a new little dresser , some sheets , and whatever else it will take .   she 'll help she set it up tonight after work .  < nl > her kindness had initially measured over two hundred dollars .   Alongside the spare room , it was all such a gesture that she quickly realized she had no concept of how to respond , so she just stuttered a thank you , and then hugged she for over five seconds .   she told she that she had already become a second mother to she , who , unlike her real mom , understood addiction , and how when people stumble , they need compassion and support , rather than an eviction , and an oath to no longer enable . she promised not to waste the opportunity she had given she .   But even though she believed at the time that she had meant what she promised , before she was even a mile from the community center , she found she detouring on her way to the Wal - mart , over to the park where the men in the puffy jackets are always sitting on the same bench .   Soon enough , almost all her money was gone .   And now , meandering through the endless Wal - mart aisles , stuffed full everything a human being could ever covet , she encounters the sheets and the small dressers , and the prices on them .   she begins to cry . < nl >  Are she alright , she ?  she asks , mincing toward she .   she is very old and her skin is quite pale , even under the fluorescent Wal - mart lights .   Usually she would lie to ProtagonistD and send ProtagonistD along after being asked this sort of question .   But , with she , for some reason she does want to dismiss she so summarily .   Perhaps it is the lilt in her voice or perhaps it is just the frantic desperation of her situation ; regardless , she feels compelled to tell she an intimate truth . < nl >  she think she just ruined the last chance she had at a decent life ,  she says , wiping her nose on her sleeve ,  All because she ca n't control she .   All because she 'm a fucking vampire who just ca n't stop consuming and hurting people .  < nl > she goes on to unburden she to she , as if she was a priest , with the kitchenware aisle for his confessional .   she tells she about the drugs , how it began with the cooks and other waitresses all reeking of garlic after too - long shifts in the restaurant , how it migrated to parties on the weekends , and then to alleyways and abandoned buildings , how her mother would inspect her forearms with a flashlight and lock up her purse at night , how she went to the meetings , but spent most of it on her cell phone , until it was her turn to speak , when she would stand before the crowd and just lie .   she tells she about Sandra , and how she does n't even know what she is doing in the fucking Wal - mart since she has no money left and will never again be able to look that saintly woman in the eyes . < nl >  Well , if she 're a vampire , then she 'd say she 're in the right place ,  she tells she , stroking she back gently ,  Everyone in Wal - mart is a vampire in one way or another , just insatiably consuming all this garbage .   But , you know , maybe being a vampire is the highest , best thing anyone can be these days .   So maybe she should just stop fighting against what she really are .  < nl > she chuckles a little .   she is more pragmatic than she would have expected .  That 's all well and good , but it wo n't exactly help she find a place to sleep tonight , now will it ?  she asks . < nl >  Oh she do n't know about that ,  she responds ,  she think if she really wanted to , she could still find a way to lay her head at her place , and she think she could do it without having to ever admit her little slip up to she .   Tell she , do she think she has a welcome mat outside her house ?   If not , this Wal - mart 's got a lovely selection of welcome mats , and plenty of them are cheaper than twenty bucks .   Maybe all it will take for she to get she into her house tonight is laying down a welcome mat beside her door .  < nl > she looks at she with a furrowed brow .    Okay now she 're not making any sense , what does a welcome mat have to -  < nl > she puts her wrinkled , liver spotted finger on her lips .   she leans in and whispers in her ear .   her eyes go wide . < eos > 
< sos > as we sat there , some already glazed over from their heroin class earlier , Elva was going over the correct way of injecting with a syringe . Alice was bored out of her mind . * why does every class feel the need to go over the basics , she got it after the first three classes went over the same thing * she was just glad she 'd had her daily smoke of marijuana before class otherwise she would be getting antsy by now . < nl >  psst  < nl > she turned towards the sound to see Carol leaning over from her seat and pulled this weird looking box with a screen and buttons on it from the inside of her jacket . < nl >  what is that ?  < nl >  it 's a calculator , hey , Do you wanna try some math ?  < nl >  what 's math ?  < nl >  it 's really neat , you calculate numbers and equations and stuff like that . her dad taught she .  < nl > she was trying to figure out what she was talking about when she noticed the calculator . she stopped what she was doing and practically zoomed to her side . < nl >  what are she doing with that ? !  she whispered in a panic  do n't she know what the government will do if they find out she know how to do mathematics ? !  < nl > Just then a shrill sound started coming from the camera in the corner and school security was in the room almost instantly . They grabbed she making sure that the calculator was out of sight from the rest of the class before dragging she out the door . < nl > she turned to the class and said  she 'll be right back , in the meanwhile practice what she taught you .  and she left the room following after the guards . < nl > As she pulled out the practice syringe she thought to she * she hope she 's not going to be in too much trouble , she was kinda cute * < eos > 
< sos > Alice stared at Elva , her eyes wide .    That 's ... that 's ...  her voice trailed off . she frowned , then leaned sideways , to call out down one of the quarters corridors leading off the crew 's mess . < nl >  Carol ! HEY ! JOHNSON !  < nl > she , poked her head into view from her bunk , where she had been ensconced with an electronic reader .    Someone call ?  < nl >  Is it true that humans used to put themselves in metal boxes and launch themselves off ...  she foundered for a moment , clearly forgetting the name of the planet in question , before rallying .  Off your planet with liquid fuel cannisters ?  < nl > she frowned , her small dark human nose wrinkling .  What do she mean , * used * to ?  < nl > It took she a moment to process that .    she mean they still do it ?  she asked , horror dawning . < nl >  Some people . Most of us use grav engines like the rest , but one of her old neighbours was in the Vintage Rocket Ship Society .   And that 's not even getting into the weirdos that still fly the old sub atmospheric craft ....  she stopped for a moment , snapping her fingers in an odd way that she had learned signalled that she was trying to remember something .  Airplanes . Yeah , some people are crazy enough to still drive those combustible fuel craft through our ATMOSPHERE .  < nl > There was a collective gasp .   By then , most of the crew in the mess were listening in . < nl >  Have she tried it ?  she asked curiously . < nl > she snorted .  Hell no . Why do she think she signed up on the first trade ship that would take she ? she 'm not sticking around for that nonsense .  < nl > edit : forgot an important word . < eos > 
< sos > Then Alice went to the bakery , followed annoyingly by Carol . The little bell above the door gave a soft tingle to announce her arrival . The baker and his wife looked up and smiled a hello . she politely read her list of required baked goods . While the baker gathered the required ingredients , his wife and she had a riveting conversation about the price of wheat in relation to the season . < nl > Unfortunately , this session of pleasantries was cut short by her irksome cries to get to cover . she had selfishly tagged along with she on her errands , risking her safety and sanity . her flamboyant hair was surpassed in gaudiness only by her personality . With no regard for the damage being done to the humble bakers ' livelihood , she haphazardly threw magic orbs at the rogue spirits who killed her family ( a morbid story she told everyone she came in contact with ) . < nl > she , sensibly , hid behind the counter with the bakers , attempting to reassure them during such a frightening , yet easily avoidable , situation . she even spared Tess , however undeserving , from blame . With an incredibly pompous flourish , she banished the last of the spirits back to their realm . she unapologetically walked over to where the three innocent bystanders she had just placed in harms way were seeking refuge . < nl > she , attempting to placate her massive savior complex , thanked she for her help ( even though she had caused the problem ) . The bakers even played along , most likely scared to death by such an abomination of nature . she , thanked the couple and volunteered to help them fix the damaged property first thing in the morning . she even invited she to the dinner for whom the now unobtainable breads were intended . < nl > she unfortunately accepted . < eos > 
< sos > It was big diesel - guzzling take - no - prisoners beast of a vehicle . Amphibious , bullet - proof , noisy as an earthquake and converted from some leftover war materiel that was so hot that with five spare minutes and some film you could take x - rays . Had plenty of space in the back for the things Alice needed to carry . Up front , plenty of room for she ; everything that had happened left she feeling so upset that the pounds practically fell off . she called it SLEIGH II . < nl > The radiation did n't matter to she , but it did a number on her reindeer so they were holed up for the duration . Missing Christmas 2037 was bad enough : there had been a NORAD radar on she for real and her old sleigh took a point - blank hit from a 35 kiloton anti - ballistic interceptor . she had to think quickly in those few milliseconds so she spent her magic on making sure she and her faithful reindeer survived the explosion and the fall down , down , down , towards a land full of bright and terrible lights with a thousand deadly Christmas stars overhead showing the way to Hell . < nl > she had had that old sleigh for ... forever , really . Same for her famous red toy sack . Watching them flash out of existence was heartbreaking . But it gave she something in common with the humans . she lost nearly everything , they lost everything . The only ones that were left were locked down in their shelters , pockets of dozens here and there dug into the sides of mountains and into old mines . There was n't anyone left watching the sky . Instead they watched Geiger counters and clocks and calendars , marking off a century a day at a time . < nl > So why fly ? There was n't anyone around she was trying to hide from . Green military pants , red shirt , black boots , and Mrs. Claus made some green suspenders . she wore a tight fitting cap with her old white fur puffball stitched right to the top , instead of flopping around like the old days . Leather gloves kept her hands comfortable on the wheel of SLEIGH II and she made her way overland . < nl > * * * < nl > Tucked away in their beds were the dozen or so families of * Community Shelter 8 . * The air had its characteristic twang , the smell of the filters and that weird burned smell that came through from the outside feed pipe . A construction paper christmas tree flapped against the wall in the common room , caught in the draft of the air recycler . < nl > Christmas Eve ! A whole year since they went down into their hole and they had celebrated survival in their meager way . < nl > Carol would mark a year since the world above went silent . Everyone planned on sleeping in , and there were no formal activities planned . she used to be a birthday , Christmas , celebrating hope and family . Now she was a death - day . < nl > The paper Christmas tree breezed this way , went still , and then breezed that way . < nl > If anyone was looking , they would have seen Elva . They would have seen she reach into her pocket and throw a handful of shiny dust into the air , and they would have seen she climb into a huge armored vehicle and wink away at an impossible speed towards the northwest , in fact towards the * Oak Creek Village Fallout Shelter . * < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistD and ProtagonistE had the early shift this morning . No one else was up . < nl > ProtagonistD poured ProtagonistD coffee from the pot in the common room , as usual . ProtagonistD had n't run into ProtagonistE yet , but ProtagonistE would be in the control room checking the outside instruments , routine stuff . < nl > The movement of the paper on the wall caught ProtagonistD's eye . ProtagonistD sighed . ProtagonistD was thankful that life in the shelter was boring , mostly free of drama . ProtagonistD had played a game as a kid built around the life ProtagonistD was living now - things could be so much worse . < nl > But what kind of future would ProtagonistD's children have ? Everyone decided that there would n't be gifts , just some extra rations with the menu heavy on the sweets . Had to keep things fair , the shelter had the things they * needed * and did n't make provision for something as frivolous as she gifts . < nl > A package . About as big as a filter module . Wrapped in beautiful paper and tied with a silver and green bow , and a tag tied to the knot . It had n't been there during the celebration the night before . < nl > Had someone been holding on to this for a whole year ? ProtagonistD smiled as ProtagonistD went over to pick it up , and it was a little heavy for its size . ProtagonistD wanted to show it to ProtagonistE , so ProtagonistD made ProtagonistD's way to the control room . < nl >  Knock knock ,  ProtagonistD said .  You 're not going to believe it .  < nl >  You know ?  ProtagonistE asked . < nl >  About the present ?  < nl >  What ?  ProtagonistE was busier on the instruments that ProtagonistE usually was . < nl >  Hold on ,  ProtagonistD set the gift down ,  what are ProtagonistE talking about ?  < nl >  Look , look through the periscope .  < nl > ProtagonistD looked . It was snowing outside . It made ProtagonistD's stomach sick . The last time ProtagonistD saw snow , it was made of ash , of buildings and things and animals and people . A whole year . * A whole year * , ProtagonistD thought , * and someone pressed the button again . * < nl >  God , no ...  ProtagonistD whispered .  How hot is it ?  ProtagonistD asked ProtagonistE . < nl >  It 's not .  < nl > ProtagonistD's eyes went to the geiger counter . And it read : < nl > * * 000 * * < nl >  The meter 's broken ,  ProtagonistD reasoned . < nl >  It 's not ,  ProtagonistE replied .  ProtagonistE just finished double - checking with the test source . Meter works . That 's real snow and there 's no radiation outside .  They sat together quiet for a few seconds .  ProtagonistD were saying something when ProtagonistD came in ,  ProtagonistE said . < nl > ProtagonistD looked at the present , wrapped up and pretty .  ProtagonistD was going to ask ProtagonistE if ProtagonistE knew where that came from .  < nl > ProtagonistE looked confused .  What 's going * on * ?  ProtagonistE pointed at the tag .  What 's the tag say ?  < nl > FROM : SANTA < nl > TO : COMMUNITY SHELTER 8 < nl > MERRY CHRISTMAS - 2038 < nl >  ProtagonistD 'm going to open it .  ProtagonistD's fingers sunk into the paper tearing it , before ProtagonistE could suggest something else . < nl > It was a simple cardboard box underneath , and the lid slid neatly off . < nl > Corn seeds . Wheat seeds . Peas . Pepper seeds . Apple and cherry seeds . Avocado pits . A few whole potatoes . There were more and more . < nl > And a note : * For New Life * < nl > * * * < nl > I collect my stories at /r / wpforme < eos > 
< sos > Alice removed her helmet and threw it into her armor rack , sending the pristine ceremonial garb tumbling into the dirt , before collapsing into her chair . she was seething with rage , the sound of constant rainfall grating and infuriating . If only Elva had just- < nl >  she ,  The flaps of her holotent opened slightly to reveal Carol ,  ProtagonistD requests her presence in the command tent .  she paused and looked at she nervously  Presently .  < nl > she picked up a jug of wine and sent it flying in her direction , prompting her expedient removal from her general vicinity . Tightly gripping the bridge of her nose in a futile effort to calm down , she sighed heavily . Of course she wanted to see she , she never shirked away from an opportunity to criticise her betters . she would relish the opportunity to place the blame at her feet for this , of that she was certain . < nl > Ignoring her helmet she threw open the flaps of her holotent prompting an aquilan salute from any nearby legionaries . she left them to their dice games in the mud without so much as a glance , electro sandals propelling she past the remainder of her cohort and sent she storming into the command tent . < nl >  she ,  she growled before the soundproof flaps had even closed behind she , gripping ProtagonistD by the cape strap .  What happened to our god damn air support , we were sitting ducks out there .  < nl > ProtagonistD just smiled back smugly , making no effort to wriggle out of her grip .  How has the role of Primus been treating she she ? It must be tough , filling shoes as large as ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistD scoffed  Especially with operations like this one on her resume .  < nl >  You little-  she raised her hand to strike ProtagonistD before she was interrupted . < nl >  Enough !  A loud voice echoed through the large tent , stopping she dead in her tracks .  This useless squabble has no place within these walls .  < nl >  ProtagonistE ?  she asked breathlessly , before swiftly releasing ProtagonistD and turning to give ProtagonistE a proper aquilan salute .  Forgive she ProtagonistE , had she been made aware of ProtagonistE's presence I-  < nl >  she would have dropped this charade and spoken her mind freely ?  ProtagonistE said , looking up at she from the ever - changing battle map laid out on the table .  Then ProtagonistE implore she to keep ProtagonistE's presence in mind until further notice .  < nl > she opened her mouth to speak but quickly thought better of it , as ProtagonistD stood in silent salute .  Understood , ProtagonistE .  < nl > ProtagonistE was not the most people prone commander she had ever served under , but ProtagonistE's tactical brilliance was undeniable . ProtagonistE had put the 262nd legion on the map , and under ProtagonistE's command , it had known many storied triumphs . Today , however , was not one of them . < nl >  The Air support ,  ProtagonistE grumbled at them , eyes fixed on the previous battle playing out in front of ProtagonistE .  They were relieved of ProtagonistE's command not but 5 hours ago .  < nl > They stood in shock , waiting for an explanation that never came . Eventually , she caved . < nl >  ProtagonistE , with respect ,  she started < nl >  ProtagonistF has demanded additional support for ProtagonistF's campaign on Varinia IV ,  ProtagonistE scratched the back of ProtagonistE's head ,  Hence the loss of the bulk of our atmospheric strike craft and troop delivery vehicles .  < nl >  So we are to abandon the planet then ?  ProtagonistD asked , at which point ProtagonistE looked up to stare at ProtagonistD sternly .  ProtagonistE ?  < nl >  No , we are to proceed with the offensive until further notice ,  < nl >  But without-  ProtagonistE protested < nl > ProtagonistE slammed ProtagonistE's fists into the battle map hard .  Without them , we are still the 262nd legion of the Emperor !  ProtagonistE's teeth ground together tightly as ProtagonistE shouted .  And the 262nd legion does not know defeat !  < nl > ProtagonistE stared them down until they both gave ProtagonistE a nod which allowed ProtagonistE to slip deflated back into ProtagonistE's seat .  ProtagonistE want a new approach strategy by sun - up ,  ProtagonistE sighed heavily  Dismissed .  < nl > As they left the holotent , ProtagonistD made sure they were far enough away before ProtagonistD exploded . < nl >  she is gon na kill us all ,  ProtagonistD looked pale even as ProtagonistD fumed  Without vehicles we wo n't last a week camped out into the open like this , let alone manage an assault on she .  < nl > she hated it when ProtagonistD was right , but she could n't deny the truth in ProtagonistD's words . They had both seen it in she , that mad hunger for victory which had ultimately consigned them to a fate of inevitable death and ruin . < nl >  We have to do something ,  ProtagonistD muttered ,  We could poison her wine or something , convince she that this plan is utter madness .  < nl >  We 'd risk martyring she ,  she bit away at her nails as her mind worked overtime .  Plus , it would be an act of high treason if anyone found out .  < nl > ProtagonistD scoffed  Rather that than a slow and agonizing death ,  < nl >  It may not come down to either ,  she smiled as she turned to face ProtagonistD .  Can we secure enough supplies for a cohort to last up to two weeks in the mountain passes .  < nl > she thought about it for a second .  How quickly ?  < nl >  Ideally tomorrow .  < nl > she pulled out a holobook and scratched down a few calculations .  In theory , yes , but-  < nl >  Perfect , she 'll ready her men for the trek and we 'll reconvene at sun - up .  she smirked as she slapped ProtagonistD on the shoulder .  Bring ProtagonistD's hiking cape .  < nl >  Wait , ProtagonistD 'm coming with ?  < nl > she shrugged .  ProtagonistD can take ProtagonistD's chances with the palisade , but she would n't bet on it still standing by the time we come back .  < nl >  Fine ,  ProtagonistD answered grimly  But what the hell do we tell ProtagonistE .  < nl > she smiled back .  The truth ,  she patted the vibrosword at her side .  That we 're gon na go kill some aliens .  < eos > 
< sos > The protocol was simple enough for even the least educated slave to understand . They were to wait for the master of ceremonies to declare that dinner had commenced , and for the accompanying music to play , before they strode into the great hall of the * Ignitus * . A hundred dishes , balanced on the palms of a hundred slaves , a meal fit for the gods . < nl > Except that when it came time for them to exit , Alice remained in her place , no more than twenty paces away from Carol . she ignored her fellow slaves who tugged at her sleeves , and instead shooed them away . They scattered , nervously tugging at the collars around their throats . < nl >  she ,  she said . But those of House Mercellus did n't hear she - they were too absorbed in the events beyond the plexiglass panels , those invisible barriers which separated them from the cold embrace of space . In the distance , tiny stars burned and flared in rapid succession . < nl >  she ,  she repeated , more firmly this time .  she bring urgent news . she !  < nl >  Hmm ? she , not now , please ,  said she .  There is a time and place for everything . We 've travelled this far out to watch this phenomena with our own eyes , so whatever it is she 're complaining about this time , it can wait . she promise , she will listen to she later-  < nl >  No , she , she need to hear this now . This * very instant * .  < nl > her tone was more than enough for the guards nearby to rouse from their lethargy . They gripped their shock - lances and thrummed them to life . Other slaves had paid the price for far less insubordination , but even they knew that she was a favourite here , and so they waited on her response . Far easier to follow a cue than to strike their own path . < nl >  she said , later . Now is not the time .  she was a fair man , more patient than most , but a shadow of displeasure had manifested in a scowl on her face .  Do not try her patience , she .  < nl > she shrugged , then flung the dish she had brought in against the far side of the great hall . The fine ceramics shattered against the plexiglass , and as pickled pork knuckles slid down , she , and her brothers and sisters , leapt to their feet . < nl >  How dare she ! Have she gone mad !  she held her bracelet up high , then said ,  Are she spoiling for a beating , she ? A simple press of this button , and she do n't care how well - trained she are , she will have no choice but to * submit * !  < nl >  We have walked into a trap , she . If we do not respond now , all is lost .  < nl > she noted , with a measure of satisfaction , the confusion which settled over them like cobwebs - too fine to grasp , too unnatural to ignore . < nl >  There 's no such thing as a ' chain - link of star explosions ' . That 's a lie . House Marcellus was lured out here to this unmanned sector of space for a reason .  < nl >  Watch her tongue , she ! Remember her place ! she was given good intel that this once - in - a - lifetime occurrence was-  < nl >  What those are , * she , are warp - drive destination beacons . her enemies are moving in on her this very second , and she do n't even know it .  < nl >  Nonsense , again ! Even if that were true , the * Ignitus * has three guard starships in close range ! We are hardly at any risk here .  < nl > she sighed .  This is a classic Drusan tactic , she . Where she come here , we like to divide our enemies , jam their communications , then pick them off one by one . And if our enemies choose to serve themselves up to us , spend their time gawking at fireworks instead of getting ready for war ... well , then , so be it . But before she go any further to chastise she , please , just try linking up with the other ships .  < nl > The smile on her face only grew wider as she watched she , then her brothers and sisters , all take turns on their personal communicators . she waited until every single face had turned white before she continued . < nl >  You still have time , she can still help ,  she said , as she pointed in the direction of the plexiglass again .  By her estimates , the enemy ships will still need about ... ten minutes to get in range . If we can get-  < nl >  Tell her guards what they need to know ,  said she .  she 'll have Elva here , she can tell she what they need to do .  < nl >  No , she wo n't do that ,  said she . she tapped her collar , then smiled .  Are she really going to have us argue about chain of command when there 's a battle around the corner . No . Set she free . she will lead them for she .  < nl > They would have argued further - it was in both their natures . But it was also at that moment that the alarms sounded . It was not a sharp , abrasive alarm . Instead , it was a low - toned , roiling alarm , one which brought to mind deep - sea whales going about their mating calls . It reverberated through the hall , grinding against their bones . < nl >  she ,  said she .  Not much time left . Set she free , and she promise she , she will have the enemy pushed back within the hour . Either that , or we can all perish here .  < nl > she sighed , then tapped the unlock sequence into her bracelet . Then , when it failed to register , she tapped it in again , faster this time . Still , where there was supposed to be a confirmatory * beep * to signal that she had released her restraints , there was no response at all . < nl >  Strange ,  she said .  It ca n't seem to detect that she ...  < nl > she reached behind her neck , then unclasped her collar . It came off with a pop , and she dropped it with a resounding bang . < nl >  she had already deactivated it she ,  she said .  she just wanted to see if she would place her trust in she . And since she evidently have , though with some prodding , she 'll see that she 're not disappointed .  < nl > she walked over to ProtagonistD , then wrested ProtagonistD's shock - lance away from ProtagonistD . she drove it hard into the ground , and its tip lit up in an electric fire . The glow against her face only served to underscore the bloodthirst in she . < nl >  she 'll show ProtagonistD what a Drusan warrior can do , ProtagonistD . Then , perhaps , ProtagonistD can re - evaluate whether ProtagonistD really did manage to enslave her people , or whether we entered ProtagonistD's service for a reason .  < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos >  Okay Alice , so who did she want to be today ?  < nl > she looked down at her feet .  I'unno . she just wanna ... she just wanna walk again . And hug her brother .  < nl >  Well , I can give she telekinesis- she could move her own body that way . Or I could make she an exoskeleton .  I gulped . It was usually easier with the kids who wanted something outlandish . The ones who just wanted to do something normal were a lot harder , making someone /just/ telekinetic enough to move their own body was a lot more difficult than outright giving them the general power . It needed to be highly refined , accounting for weight and the feeling of moving ones own body . < nl > Somehow , it was a lot more satisfying , too . < nl >  Tele - tele , whatever . she wo n't need a big heavy machine , right ?  < nl >  Nope ,  I replied .  But she 'll need a little practice .  < nl >  she 'd like that .  < nl >  Okay . she 're going to need to sit on that thing in the corner so I can weigh and measure she , okay ? The nurses will give she a hand .  < nl > I planned my camera and got to work . Weight calibrations . she 'd be able to walk by the sheer force of will , which she had in spades . < nl > If she survived treatment she 'd need to come back pretty often for a power adjustment . Sadly , if someone was sent to me , that usually meant it was a last wish . You had to be very far gone to even be allows it or ... < nl > Well , most people died from prolonged exposure , I mused , running the subroutine that was the former shred of my humanity . < nl > It was still better than the alternative . < eos > 
< sos > As Alice awoke , < nl > she first thought it a joke , < nl > That the night before was so clear . < nl > But with a cold creeping sweat , < nl > she did recollect , < nl > How the Dwarves had rung in New Year . < nl > Carol , < nl > Had drunk all the champagne , < nl > And went streaking down through the hall . < nl > Elva thought it a lass , < nl > Complimented she , < nl > But got more than she bargained for . < nl > As for ProtagonistD , < nl > ProtagonistD lowered ProtagonistD's shoulders , < nl > As ProtagonistD watched ProtagonistD's husband be kissed . < nl > Although a mistake , < nl > His trousers did quake , < nl > she had stolen ProtagonistD's bliss . < nl > With swift resolution , < nl > ProtagonistD found a solution , < nl > As ProtagonistD sharpened the blade of ProtagonistD's axe . < nl > First ProtagonistD did trim , < nl > But ProtagonistD's hair was still grim , < nl > So for the first time , a dwarf did wax . < nl > When she saw ProtagonistD , < nl > she said ' ProtagonistD she adore ProtagonistD , < nl > she forgot 'bout the goods under there . ' < nl > But ProtagonistD did scolder , < nl > Shoved she up by a boulder , < nl > Said ' ProtagonistD 'm more than what 's under ProtagonistD's hair ! ' < nl > ' Lover forgive ProtagonistD , < nl > ProtagonistD know ProtagonistD 'm no Gimli , < nl > ProtagonistD 'm begging you please take ProtagonistD back . ' < nl > ' Only if you do the same ... < nl > If you can handle the pain , < nl > Of waxing each crevis and crack . ' < nl > she remembered , < nl > The tears that descended , < nl > The face of a man full of fear . < nl > she reached for a bottle , < nl > her memory she 'd throttle , < nl > Of another damned Dwarven New Year . < eos > 
< sos >  Explain to me again how it works ?  < nl > We 're in bed . It 's warm . Heavy down . The ceiling fan * clap - clap - claps * . < nl > Alice rubs my chest . Stares up at the fan . < nl >  They ... well , she guess they sort of * shoot * electricity into your brain ,  she says .  Not a lot . A little . Then you have like a seizure . Then it 's over .  < nl >  Sounds awful ,  I say .  How 's it help ?  < nl >  Kinda resets your brain , she think .  she 's making that face . Pursed lips . Half - closed eyes . The * Worry Has Turned to Anger * face .  It 's probably a scam . Just torture . Just taking her money .  < nl >  But Carol ...  < nl >  Yeah . she thinks it 'll help .  < nl > The hand is still on my chest .  Are she mad at me for making she go ?  < nl > she does n't answer . she probably is , but does n't want to say .  You ca n't make she do anything . she went because she went .  < nl >  I thought it 'd just be talking ,  I say .  I thought that 's what therapy is . Just talking . Maybe some drugs .  < nl >  It 's that ,  she says , nodding .  And sometimes , when * that * does n't work , it 's things like ECT . Nobody knows .  she sighs .  Nobody knows . It 's all guessing .  < nl >  Did talking make she feel better at all ?  < nl > she gets up off the bed .  Not any better than talking to you .  < nl >  I 'm not a therapist .  < nl >  You 're a good listener .  < nl >  Well .... yeah .  < nl >  Talking helps . It helps she understand things . But she need a little more than understanding .  she finds one of the many framed pictures in the room , picking it up , looking at the image , then setting it back down - face down - on her dresser . All the pictures are like that . Face down . she does n't like seeing the faces of her friends and family until she wants to see the faces . she does n't like them watching she . < nl >  How many times ?  < nl > she looks at me .  How many times do she have to shoot electricity into her brain ? Dunno . Maybe 10 maybe 50 . It causes memory problems . Looking forward to that ...  < nl >  Oh . But that 's not ...  < nl >  It 's like changing the wiring in her brain ,  she says .  It 'll help ... it'll just help . Or it wo n't .  < nl >  Then it 's worth trying .  < nl > she nods , then moves to the door .  Okay . she got ta go . Mom 's taking she . You be good . You 're in charge while she 'm gone .  < nl >  I 'm always good ,  I say .  Good luck .  < nl > she smirks , opens the doors , then leaves . I 'm alone . The ceiling fan * clap - clap - claps * . I ca n't move . I can only wait . I can only watch the ceiling fan . I can only wonder who she 'll be when she comes back . If anything will change . < nl > I could n't do anything that day in her first room , the pink and white one , with unicorns and a towering dollhouse in the corner . I could only sit on her pillow , there in the dark , on the day after Christmas , as her uncle crept into the room and whispered things into her ear , things I could n't hear . Eventually I fell on the floor . Eventually I was knocked under the bed . I think that 's why she still talks to me . Why she does n't mind me looking at she . Because I was n't looking at she then . Like the framed pictures were . And the posters were . And the dolls were . < nl > This is our fourth bedroom . Things change . Things stay the same . I 've sat on so many pillows and watched she lose she . Watched she hurt she . Watched her wrap braided blankets around her throat and look desperately for some place to hang the other end . < nl > All I 've ever been able to do is talk to she . Or , I suppose , mostly just listen . < nl > Somewhere far , far away , I feel something like a tingle . Like I 've come out of the dryer and I 'm crackling all over . The feeling lasts less than a minute , but at the end I can no longer hear the ceiling fan . I can no longer see the bedroom door . < nl > I 'm still here . Still me . But all that is is just a dusty , gray bear . Flattened . Patchy . < nl > There 's nothing to hear and there 's nothing to see . There 's nothing to say . < nl > I ca n't say anything at all . < nl > Then I remember that really , I never could , could I ? < nl > Everything is dark . < nl > At least I still remember she . < nl > That 's more than enough for an old bear like me . < eos > 
< sos >  OK now  muttered Alice  this is getting ridiculous  . she stared at Carol . < nl > she noticed she staring , instead of summoning dark flocks of crows .  What is it , too scared to fight ?  she raised an eyebrow . < nl > she sputtered ,  No , she am just apalled at the direction the league of heros has apparently taken  . she called her powers now , ravenous shadows emerging from her finely tailored cloak .  Why on earth does her suit have a boob window now ? What even is the point of the suit ? ! she might as well be wearing a t - shirt !  < nl > Wings of fire radiated from her shoulders , flapping once and scorching the air around she .  Hey now , she think it looks alright , and besides , suits are for the public in her case , not for protection .  < nl > her shadows coalesced into something larger , its ghastly call echoing off the scyscrapers of New London .  And why is it skin tight ? ! I 've seen porn , nay , MOST PORN has less fetishized gear . What happened to the classy gold armor ? Or that one red dress ?  < nl > she let her fire cloak she , but kept shouting , embarassed  That dress was n't even a suit ! And what if this is more comfortable ? < nl >  And why is her phoenix dive now shaped like a naked women ! ? ! ? !  she was ignoring she now  Instead of a PHOENIX ? The league has you changing your TECHNIQUES ? They might as well call you  Naked Fire Women  now ! This is just , this is unconscionable , she respect she too much for this to stand , she am going to have a word with Myst , this is ridic-his words were cut off as the flaming giant rammed in to she . < nl > ---- < nl >  Soooooo , how was she  Aura said slyly . < nl > she huffed  she got away  . < nl >  Now , you know that 's not what I 'm asking about  < nl >  FINE , she hated it , ok ?  she groaned ,  she was just trying to be more appealing you know ?  < nl > Aura nodded sagely ,  Told she . Maybe she should , I do n't know , actually try flirting like a normal person ?  < nl >  she have literally no experience dating ok ! ?  she grumbled  she did say she respected she ! Maybe we should try a new suit , you know , the gold armor one .  < nl >  That 's what I told she to stick with ! We know windows are out , but she could be a bit more subtle about it ! Want it to have armor - boobs this time ?  < nl >  .... maybe  . < eos > 
< sos > The crash and boom from the front of the bank echoed throughout the whole building .   Alice sat up with a scowl . < nl >  The hell 's goin' on out there ?    she roared at her minions .   They scurried away , having the presence of mind to know that she was not in a good mood .   she did n't like disturbances , and that sounded like a disturbance . < nl > Carol just shook her head , turning back to the locked vault she was at work on .   Breaking into banks was not at all her style , but she did n't get to choose where the folks with the tech kept their goods .   she 'd been at this game a long , * long * time , as the grey lacing her hair proved .   Sometimes , you just had to adapt . < nl > The sound of footsteps brought she up short . < nl >  What was it ?    she hissed , craning her head around , and then stopped . < nl > The sight before she was not her sweaty , black - jacketed thugs for hire .   Elva loomed over she , six feet of taut , gently muscled woman topped with a mane of strawberry blonde hair . < nl >  Not what she were expecting ?    she purred , flicking a finger idly .   A little ball of fire swirled at the tip with every twitch . < nl > she stared , eyes narrowed .   she 'd been in the business a long time .   The fashion trends of heroes had always been a moving target - ranging from the universally unappealing unitard designs of the earliest Gifted to the more risque adopted by the ' forward thinking ' women heros of the last decade .   she was well used to seeing more of a hero than she ever really * wanted * to . < nl > But this ... < nl >  Is n't that uncomfortable ?    she blurted out , eyeing she incredulously .   The way the fabric was cut out in strategic areas , leaving skin exposed ... the high cut around the sides ... It * had * to be riding up .   There was no way she * was n't * pulling spandex out of her ass every three minutes .   she blinked , competely taken aback . < nl >  Excuse she ?    she said slowly , the words ominously drawn out .   The little fireball circling her finger was n't so little anymore .   she 'd really rather not be burned to cinders in the little room .   she turned back to the vault , just so that she would n't have to look at she .   she was * not * blushing , she told she . < nl > she could end this .   she could put a stop to this , right now .   she just reeked of green inexperience .   But , she knew her own powers , and , well .   If she stepped in , with she like * that * , there was only one way this was going to end . < nl > she could n't quite bring she to go there .   Not yet . < nl >  she thought she were so clever , eh , she ?    she drawled , slowly circling around she .   her head swiveled around stubbornly , facing the other way no matter how she wandered .    she did n't * really * think she could just waltz in here and take it , did she ?  < nl > she ground her teeth together in frustration .   It was like she was reading the script to some horrible , cheesy cartoon . < nl >  This her first week ?    she managed .   The pacing stopped . < nl >  That 's not relevant , is it ?   Hands where she can see them , * she * .   Nice and high .  < nl > she glanced up .   she was standing right in front of she .   The fabric - what little there was of it - was drawn tight , like the slightest nudge would send she spinning free .   she gulped .   she was young enough to be her * daughter * , damnit .   This was * not * in the job description . < nl >  she 'd rather not , if that 's all right with she .    she muttered , spreading her hands out to either side .   she clicked her tongue , resuming her walk .   her high stilletos groaned in complaint . < nl >  Whatever .   Police will be here soon anyway .  < nl >  Just thought she seemed new .   That 's tough , she feel she .   It's ... hard for new Gifted to get their costumes tailored in time .  she started , eyes still downturned .   The thought of she continuing like this just did n't sit right with she .   If she was n't going to let she talk head - on , then she 'd come at it from the side . < nl >  Oh , that was n't a problem .    she said , laughing under her breath .    she know her way around a sewing machine .  < nl >  Made it she , did she ?    she said weakly . < nl >  she like to stand on her own , when she can .   she about done ?  < nl >  Oh , she 'm just musin ' .   Do n't mind an old man .    she said quickly , plastering an innocent grin onto her face .    Only , the Enhancement from the shops are * pretty useful * .    she tried to make her tone as convincing as possible .    she 'd hate for she to get hurt by somethin' she were n't expectin ' .  < nl > The proper tailoring shops would * also * never , ever allow their heros to walk around in something like * that * .   she was going to catch a cold , even if she did n't get taken out by a villain looking at she the wrong way . < nl > Distantly , she could hear the sound of sirens , and swore softly .   she chuckled , her voice low and soft . < nl >  Almost time , is n't it ?   Keep those hands out , now .   No tricks .  < nl >  No tricks .    she said , still with that dumb grin on her face .   she was an idiot .   A well - meaning idiot , but she could n't stand around and let she get she hurt right at the start of her career . < nl > And so when she lapped she again , making one last round of the little back room , she threw her amplifiers into overdrive . < nl > she shrieked , throwing her arms up reflexively as the vibrations shook the air .   she had one last instant to confirm that yes , in fact , the laws of physics were still functioning , and then she slammed her eyes shut . < nl > Pushing her way past she , she made for the door .   she was going to be cutting things * close * .   her men were screwed , but that was their own damn fault .   It was n't worth her skin to save them . < nl > One last glance over her shoulder showed she sitting in a quivering , trembling heap , grabbing at the scraps of cloth that used to be her uniform .   All of the clever bits of glue she 'd used to hold she in had given up in the face of simple resonant vibrations , all of the teensy straps holding artistically cut sections snapped by tension . < nl > The police were going to get a * show * when they came to arrest she , she thought .   The thought did n't make she happy , although she * was * a little satisfied with she regardless .   she 'd done a good deed that day .   And they said all villains were evil . < nl > she could manage one more , while she was at it . < nl >  There 's a great little costuming shop , down by that hero mechanic 's garage .   South District .   Ask for ProtagonistD .    she said , pausing at the doorway .    Tell ProtagonistD she sent she , and ProtagonistD might even .... ah ... squeeze she in .  < nl > Before she could say a word , rapidly turning incandescent from rage or humiliation , she fled , unable to contain her grin . < nl > ( /r / inorai , critiques always welcome ! ) < eos > 
< sos > From beneath the comforting fabric of Alice's black robe , she sighed . This had to be her third museum heist this year already , and it 's not like there were that many museums to pick from . At this rate , she 'd have to start stealing from the Musical Instrument Museum or the History of Dairy Museum soon . < nl > Still : the display of Incan Relics at the Museum of Indigenous Peoples was worth the risk of repeating oneself . As a bonus , the artifacts were valuable enough that people would assume she was stealing them just to re - sell them , never guessing she * true * purpose . < nl > she adjusted her burnished metal eye - mask , scanning the room carefully . After she was done here , she could do some banks , maybe try a government building to shake things up . she was getting to a point where she had her legacy to think about , after all . < nl > she approached the first display case and carefully rolled down one of her elbow - length gloves , sliding it off and folding the black silk in her hand . she delicately placed a carefully manicured finger on the glass and waited as obsidian waves emanated from the point of contact . she felt the resistance give way as the surface changed to dark ether , then casually reached in and grabbed the ceremonial headdress waiting within . < nl > her cloak rustled as she turned on the heel of one of her knee - length boots , moving on to the next relic . Just as she was about to lay her hand on the case , she froze . < nl > Garish fluorescent lights began flashing around the walls of the room . A rich , baritone voice behind she commanded ,  Stop right there , she ! she have been caught red - handed by Carol .  < nl > she groaned .  That is , hands down , the * worst * name she 've ever heard ,  she called out , still not moving ,  and keep in mind that she 've faced off against * Fry Guy * and someone who called himself * Montezuma 's Revenge * .  < nl >  Divulging her evil plan will not help save she from her technological might , she ! she are about to get a one - way ticket to Justice Town !  < nl > At this , she turned around , a fiery retort on her lips . Whatever she was about to say , though , ended up coming out as a quiet  What in the actual f--  < nl > Standing before she , arms akimbo , legs shoulder length apart , was ... she actually was n't quite sure what she was looking at , because the colored lights she had noticed earlier were sweeping across her vision . < nl >  Listen , would she mind ... turning those off ? she think she 're going to give she epilepsy if she look at she much longer .  < nl > she frowned , then brought a forearm to chest level and touched some buttons on a small control panel there . The lights turned off .  It 's cyan , magenta , yel --  < nl >  she do n't care . At all  she interjected . < nl > There was an awkward pause as her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting in the museum . she broke the silence :  she wield the power of a * computer * ! Now , she will use her technology to turn on the lights - without using a switch !  < nl > she shook her head .  Look , she , let she give she some -- holy hell what is * that * ?  < nl > she had turned 90 degrees , aiming her wrist control at   the wall , and then paused .  What is what ?  < nl > she had not noticed in the low light before , but now that she was in profile ... < nl >  Are she - she can't ... is that a * codpiece * ! ?  < nl > she looked downward , then back at she .  she don't ... think so . What 's a codpiece ?  < nl > All that was visible of her face beneath her hood was her mouth , and it was currently contorted in horror .  she ... that 's * she * ? Good God ! Get ... get ... some compression shorts , or a ... a cup , or ... duct tape ? Something . * Anything * .  < nl >  Ha ha ha ! Your attempts to distract she will not work !  she clicked a button and light flooded the room . she screamed . < nl >  Ahh ! It 's even worse ! Where is the rest of it ? Why are she ... did she shave her * abdomen * but not her * legs * ? And ... are those ... are those * nipples * ?  < nl > she shifted awkwardly as she looked down again . she had a molded breastplate that left her midriff bare , like some sort of medieval sports bra . The lights were mounted on the shoulders . Below the waist , she was wearing tight - extremely tight - shorts , and they were definitely short . she looked like a basketball player from the early 80 's . For reasons that she could not fathom , there was nothing from her mid - thigh to her lower calf , leaving her hairy legs exposed . < nl >  What ?  she frowned .  she made it she !  < nl > her lips were now closed tight , the corners of her mouth twitching .  she ... don't say .  she looked she over again , cocking her head to one side .  Oh ... oh , honey , no . What 's on her head ?  < nl >  It 's a fedora . Why ?  < nl > her body was shaking with barely repressed laughter now .  But ... what 's on top of her ... fedora ?  < nl >  It 's the energy pack ! she could n't figure out how to strap it on she without it burning she . See ?  < nl > she turned around and showed her bare lower back , which was marred by an ugly , rectangular welt . < nl > It was too much . she threw her head back and the empty museum rooms echoed with the sounds of her cackles . her eyes were wide as she stared down at the floor .  she need to power her unit somehow ,  she said quietly . < nl >  her UNIT !  she shrieked , tears running freely down her face .  To be honest , she think her * unit * has plenty of power already ! Oh ... oh ... she think she peed she a little . Your unit !  she continued laughing , dabbing at her eyes with the glove she had removed earlier .  Okay , kid , she ... she ca n't take this anymore . she 'll go with she if she promise to never go out in public dressed like this ever again .  < nl > she had mostly recovered but every now and then something would set she off and she would lapse into a burst of giggles . she gave a somber nod , her face tight , and escorted she out of the building . < nl > * * * < nl > /r / ShadowsofClouds < eos > 
< sos > It was always difficult , adapting to a new body . It was probably the most challenging aspect of covert reconnaissance missions . < nl > Issues like understanding the local language and culture , those were merely a matter of information absorption and enough simulation time . < nl > Adapting to a new body , however , a new biology , that was different . < nl > It always surprised people , when Alice told them . Because the remarkable similarity of sapient organic life across the galaxy was a known fact , something every schoolchild knew and accepted . < nl > It seemed there were only so many successful body plans . Most aquatic races shared common body shapes . And similarly , most land dwellers were bilaterally symmetrical bipeds . < nl > There were indisputable advantages to the usual packages of features . Opposable thumbs for tool use , walking upright for energy - efficient - if unstable - locomotion , warm - blooded biology for better temperature control . < nl > But still , adapting to a new body always bothered she . < nl > That was difficult for many of her friends and family to understand . They did n't quite comprehend when she explained the issue . < nl > Certainly , there were issues such as the different proportions of arms and legs , the specific posture and stance demanded by bone structure . But those were matters that knowledge implants and automated reflex systems were designed to deal with . < nl > Intellectually , there should n't have been any difficulty . < nl > And in practical terms , there was n't any problem . In practical terms , she could function . The implanted knowledge , the recorded skills , these addressed the functional challenges . < nl > The many subsystems installed in her new body handled issues like balance , or precision in delicate physical movement . There was , for example , no need to learn how to walk in the new body . That was all handled for she . < nl > It was the mental portion that was the disruptive aspect . Getting used to it on an emotional level . Living inside a new skin . Breathing in the scents of an alien atmosphere . Feeling comfortable with a strange face . < nl > That was the challenge , on a purely visceral level . < nl > she was good at her job , though . < nl > It took a particular kind of personality to willingly spend entire stellar cycles encased in alien flesh , living among people of a different species . < nl > It took a particular kind of personality to embrace their way of life , to pass as one of them , undetected . < nl > Or , at least , mostly undetected . < nl > she knew her emulation was n't perfect . Many of the humans she 'd met and interacted with at length likely considered she somewhat ... atypical . < nl > she 'd corrected many of her early errors , but even now , even today , there were occasional mistakes . < nl > It was fortunate , then , that the inhabitants of this planet were high enough on the civilisational scale - at least in social terms - that any of her oddities were largely accepted by the natives . < nl > They would not judge , at least not overtly . < nl > And , more importantly , they would not suspect . < nl > However , she still endeavoured to correct any mistakes . < nl > Some were her fault . Because even a highly - programmed and experienced field researcher like she ... could n't be perfect . Not quite . < nl > Some mistakes , however , were due to lack of information . There was always some nuance , some detail , some reference or area of local knowledge that the preliminary studies had overlooked . < nl > That was why she was here . Standing outside the transparent barrier of non - crystalline amorphous solid - the glass , the locals called it . Watching . Observing . < nl > It had been a simple conversation . she had thought so , anyway , until it had suddenly veered into unfamiliar territory , leaving she scrambling to cover her inadequate local knowledge . < nl > Like many sapient beings in the galaxy , humans were fairly body - conscious . That sort of vanity , that sort of focus on the aesthetics and well - being of the physical form ... it was not completely universal , but it was a common trait . < nl > she 'd been very pleased , when she 'd discovered how much of the local electronic public - access information networks were dedicated to pornography in all its myriad forms . An observer could learn a lot about a civilisation from watching their pornography . < nl > But what they 'd missed was the fact that , to put it simply , body - modification technology was in its relative infancy on this planet . < nl > They had some degree of cosmetic surgical augmentation . Some degree of performance - enhancing biotechnology . Yet it was all remarkably primitive by interstellar standards , compared to the relative sophistication of their other sciences . < nl > For a civilisation at this overall technical and social level of development , she would have expected more . < nl > she 'd become aware of that gap , when discussing a device Carol had acquired . < nl > They had been standing in the communal rest area at their workplace , at the place of employment she 'd inserted she into , as part of her local identity . < nl > she had shown off a new wrist device , apparently a commercial electronic product used to track and record a human 's physical movement . < nl > she had then asked about her own exercise routine . < nl > she 'd deflected the question . she was , of course , aware of the concept , and she knew humans practiced it . But she had no actual need to do it she , considering that much of her own body was synthetic , simply designed to mimic a human body . < nl > The small proportion of it that was biological , actual human - compatible flesh , was maintained in optimum condition by her mechanical systems . < nl > The encounter had made she aware that her appearance , her size , her muscle tone , her general standard of health , and other physical factors ... would naturally lead most humans to assume that she did perform exercise regularly . They would assume she was familiar with their places of exercise , the facilities known as gymnasiums , or gyms . < nl > she did not know much about these places , save for scattered references in the entertainment media she had reviewed . That cursory knowledge had been enough to navigate the conversation to a satisfactory conclusion . < nl > But she resolved to address this gap in her knowledge . < nl > That had led she to this location , a gym that she had recommended when she 'd claimed to be ' between routines ' . < nl > her colleague had added that , aside from its comprehensive inventory of machines designed to assist humans in the practice of exercise , the gym was also a ' studio ' that offered instructional courses in a variety of disciplines , all exercise - related activities . < nl > her colleague had believed she would be interested . < nl > she was now observing one of these classes , through the glass . < nl > At first she had been confused . Two humans had appeared to be engaging in combat . But there was no hostility , no sense of threat . And , very unsettlingly , the other humans were quietly observing , but making no move to stop the combatants . < nl > Then the two had separated , made a respectful gesture to each other , before turning to the other gathered humans . < nl > The group had then repeated the movements shown to them by the instructors . And they were instructors - she 'd realised that , belatedly . It made sense in context . This was , of course , a training facility . < nl > she looked at the group , and the building around she . she considered this data point . < nl > The humans learned physical skills . They had to . There was , clearly , more to operating their bodies than the ... purely instinctive . < nl > And they did not have , she realised , any means of installing these lessons . No significant body modifications meant no knowledge implants . < nl > she looked at the class . The movements were ... sophisticated , she realised . Easily the rival of any of the standard recorded patterns in her own library , used for the disabling and restraint of hostile humanoid sapients . < nl > Some of the movements , she realised , were unknown to she . Not recorded in her database . Perhaps that was merely because she was a researcher , not a combat specialist , but she had a sudden suspicion ... < nl > she 'd been observing the humans for a while . They were an interesting species , but she had n't seen any sign of ... genius . No sign of anything special , no sign of any area in which they were extraordinary by galactic standards . < nl > But this ... < nl >  Kinesthetics ,  she said out loud . < nl >  What 's that , she ?  < nl > she half - turned , glancing at the human behind the reception counter , the one meant to receive arrivals to the facility . < nl >  Sorry ,  she said , commanding she to laugh , in feigned mild embarassment . she had a subroutine for that , and it was now practiced habit to trigger the appropriate systems . she also activated the custom movement she 'd programmed in , which lifted her hand to rub the back of her neck .  Just talking to she .  < nl >  No worries ,  the receptionist said .  she like the class ?  < nl >  Oh , uh , yeah ,  she replied ,  it 's awesome . Super cool . But , it 's just , she was just thinking , she ca n't see she doing something like that .  < nl >  she look like she work out , though ,  the human observed , sounding curious . < nl > she glanced down at her body .  Well , she guess ? But that 's not what she meant . she 'm a klutz . No coordination , yeah ? she could n't do all that , uh , Kung Fu shit .  < nl > The receptionist smiled .    Hey , do n't sell she short . We 've got a range of self - defence courses for all skill levels . There 's a free introductory thing on Saturdays , for beginners . she could come , see if she like it . No pressure . No harm trying , right ?  < nl >  she ,  she said , slowly , thinking it over .  she guess ? Uh , she mean , sure ?  < nl >  Great , great , I 've got a flyer here , or you can check out the times on our website ...  < nl > * * * < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/7pvelr / wp_to_most_of_the_galaxy_turning_your_body_into_a / dsm6lvy/ ) < eos > 
< sos > Alice was the closest the living could get to being a ghost . she glided through the town at night in long gowns going nowhere except for oblivion . her face and shoulders were deathly pale and her hair was a startling silver that just barely touched the ground . When she appeared , people avoided she , they would cross the street to avoid being on the same side of the road as she , whisper when she was out of earshot , mothers scared their children with tales of she , and the bards sang tales of the tragic beauty of the last of Carol , the cursed line . her tale was second only to the stories of the Hole . The one at the edge of town with no end , the one that scared away many and attracted even more . < nl > Of course , the tale Clarise Fae is a story about the Hole . For every night , she would wander the town , but in the end she would stand at the edge of the Hole , peering down into nothing , trying to find answers when there were none . Answers for the past . < nl > she had been one of seven daughters . They all had her silvery hair , the pale skin , the eyes that seemed to hold a storm behind them . her sisters were playful , even joyous . her parents were well respected in the town - they ran a shop selling charms guarding against the spirits that came out of the hole . Often a she sister or two would be around and about in the shop helping out their parents , and playing jokes on the customers . They were often hard to tell apart , but she stood out , even then . she never smiled , never , never joked . Just obediently fetched whatever her parents asked she to from the shelves . Still , the girls were the town 's little angels - beloved by all , so few risked having children here by the Hole . < nl > So everyone in the town was heartbroken when one of them jumped in the Hole . Elva had sworn she had seen she walking about in the night and head towards the hole , almost in a trance , and of her own volition , jump in . < nl > It was a tragedy , and the whole town wept for the little life that had been winked out . < nl >  Just the nature of the Hole ,  the old muttered shaking their heads ,  some children just ca n't resist .  < nl > It was a tragedy , but nothing unheard of . Nothing unheard of . The Hole was the Hole . Slowly but surely , the town moved on , and so did the family , or as much as it was possible to move on . < nl > Apparently one of them had never quite gotten over it . Soon after , another sister was seen jumping into the Hole in the dead of night . < nl > Again , the town wept . < nl >  Children take it hard , a death , you know ,  the elders said .  The two sisters had always been closer than the rest .  < nl > But it was also around this time that the first whispers started , that one child lost to the hole is understandable , but two ? From the same family ? < nl > And just as everyone had stopped reeling in shock , another Fae jumped in , once more in the dead of night . < nl > This time the elders muttered and shook their heads . Some people stopped going to the shop , but most spat at them and comforted the Fae instead .  To lose children is bad enough , but to be scorned for it is even worse ,  they said . < nl > They stopped going when the fourth and fifth sisters jumped together . < nl > Soon after , the town saw Mother , Father , and final sister walk to the Hole hand in hand . Nobody tried to stop them , either out of fear or out of sympathy . < nl > And the life of the town was gone , just like that , taken from the hole . < nl > Or , well , not all of it . < nl > she remained , she . Yet she lived , in a sense . she never talked to anyone , getting food and water from the woods . ProtagonistD said ProtagonistD once saw she snap the neck of a squirrel in the woods and bring it home to eat . When she first walked towards the hole , the town thought it was the end of she . she would jump and put an end to the curse . < nl > But she did n't . < nl > she only stood , half of her feet off the edge , but she never did jump . < nl > On one such night ProtagonistE - a young man of about nineteen , around the same age as she . ProtagonistE was a fool , lured in by beauty , the long hair , the sad eyes . ProtagonistE Followed she in to the woods on one such trek into the hole . < nl > she glided out of the woods early morning , but ProtagonistE never did . < nl > Enough was enough . The townsfolk had let she stay despite the Hole 's Curse , but now she was a danger to others .  Better to be rid of she ,  the townsfolk reasoned .  Lest the Hole take us all .  < nl > And so they gathered behind she at night when she stood at the edge of the hole . Despite the hundred or so townsfolk behind she with torches , she did n't even bother turning around . It was like she did n't hear them , that there was nothing for she except the Hole . < nl > The townsfolk stood for a moment , doing nothing . They had expected fear , pleading , but not this , not ignorance . Eventually ProtagonistF , took initiative . ProtagonistF stepped forward , calmly and coolly , and placed a hand on her back , and without a moment 's hesitation , shoved . < nl > The Townsfolk gasped , they had wanted to drive she out , not to give she to the Hole . Not even murderers deserved that fate . < nl > But it was not she who fell . she whirled to the right just as ProtagonistF shoved , and ProtagonistF found ProtagonistF off balance from the shove . ProtagonistF's screams echoed through the forest as ProtagonistF fell into the Hole . < nl > she shook her head at the spot ProtagonistF had been , her eyes sad . And for the first time , she spoke .  You have come here trying to get rid of she , to drive she out , to kill she . she have tried to do the same for years now , to jump into this damn hole-  < nl > Without warning ProtagonistG charged she , pitchfork raised to impale she . she could have moved , but she stood there , as if accepting her fate . The Hole rumbled . < nl > And then what appeared to be a root of a Tree appeared from the Hole , grabbed ProtagonistG by the waist and dragged ProtagonistG into the Hole in a fraction of a second . < nl > Again , she barely reacted , just stood with those sad eyes .  It wants she , see , all to itself , it is very jealous , very protective ,  she said . she hook her head , and a ghost of a smile touched her lips . < nl >  The Hole is in love with she .  < nl > No one stopped she as she glided through the crowd . Away . < nl > * * * < nl > if you enjoyed , check out [ XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com / r / XcessiveWriting/ ) < eos > 
< sos > Alice gently placed a slender white palm on the rocky walls of the cave and closed her eyes . she focused , channeling all her focus onto the tips of her fingers . she could feel the concentrations of the minerals and ores beneath the surface layer of rock . A byproduct of her frankly inhuman senses . she held for a breath for a moment as she felt a tiny current of air from far beneath the rock .  * Gotcha * ,  she murmured , under her breath . < nl > Taking a step back , she gestured to the section of the rock cavern with a casual wave .  Here . Just bust through it , and we should be good .  The team of burly - looking miners grunted in assent and moved to work without a single cry of dissent . she smiled to she . It had n't taken long for she to earn their respect . her reputation of being the greatest spelunker in the world was n't just for show , after all . her abilities- well , and her drawbacks- lent she nicely to the life she 'd chosen to lead . < nl > There was her ability to see perfectly in the dark . her strength and speed made it possible to escape from the most dangerous of situations unscathed , and also made she very handy with a pickaxe if it came right down to it . she could survive for weeks on end with scarcely any food or water . And of course , there was her enhanced senses , the way the darkness reached out like an extension of her own fingertips , allowing she to find sealed off parts of cave systems or rich veins of precious ores . she was undeniably the best . < nl > Besides , a life spent underground suited she well . No need to hide under a cloak all the time , darting from shade to shade . No need to stand outside every door , waiting to be invited inside . No one lived in caves anyways . And she 'd largely weaned she off of human blood . The occasional bloody steak was more than enough for she . Perhaps most of all , no need to deal with Kresniks that did n't * get * that she did n't hurt humans . < nl > she could n't understand why her clan had disapproved so strongly of her choice , and she had the feeling that they did n't really know why either . It was passed down from generation to generation .  Never head underground . It is not a place for vampires like us .  Nothing more than folklore , some superstition made to keep young vampire children out of caves . she had snorted at the very idea , and scoffed at the suggestion that she was doing something dangerous . It was the * perfect * job for she , and she loved it . < nl > Now , she was leading a team into the deepest section of the Ruby Cave . Despite the name , there were no rubies in sight , but it was legendary nonetheless . Rumour had it that the depths of the cave held treasures beyond human imagination . Half the cave system was sealed off , blocked by dislodged rocks from an earthquake years ago . No one even knew where to start digging , but she was different . Slowly but surely , she could lead a team to where no one had set foot in a thousand years . < nl > As they burst through the thick section of rock , the tunnel opened up into a more spacious cave . she grinned , and took a step into the newly - discovered cavern . Then her whole body tensed up and froze . she could n't take another step . she tried again and again , but it was as if she 'd run into an invisible barrier . her eyes widened in shock . Could it be ? < nl > she gestured to Carol . Was she miming ? she spoke quickly and gruffly , trying to conceal the panic in her voice .  she , she go in first .  she raised her eyebrows at she , wondering what she was playing at . But she acquiesced , and took a step towards the mouth of the new cavern . Then another , and another , effortlessly gliding through the invisible barrier that had stopped she in her tracks . < nl > she furrowed her brows , her mind reeling in shock . This was someone 's * home * ? she could n't enter , not without permission . An unfortunate side - effect of being a vampire , certainly , but not one she had expected to encounter * here * . As she stood there , she heard a loud noise , rocks crashing in the distance , and a warm blast of wind shooting out from the depths of the cave . Something was * stirring * . < nl > A primal fear emerged from the deepest part of her mind . Every cell in her body was screaming ' * danger * ' . Without warning , a roar blasted out from deep within the cave , a roar that sounded monstrous . No , monstrous was an understatement . It sounded ...   * draconic * . < nl >  WHO DARES INTRUDE ON MY TERRITORY !  a voice bellowed , followed by a loud sniff .  I SMELL HUMANS ... AND A VAMPIRE ? HAS YOUR RACE FORGOTTEN THE LESSON I TAUGHT THEM ALL THOSE YEARS AGO ?  < nl > she swallowed hard , and turned around .

< sos > * Freak . * < nl > * Retard . * < nl > Alice first found out she was different when she was seven . Carol , stood in the sun , the light perfectly accentuating her toned muscles . < nl >  Now , kids ,  she said ,  You might 've all been born with the best genes out there , but if you do n't exercise properly those muscles will become smaller and weaker , and you do n't want that . Today , we 're gon na do chin - ups . It 's easy . You just walk underneath the bar , hold your arms out like this , and pull until your chin is above the bar . Of course , you 'll be using this lower bar here . Now , line up and show she what you can do .  < nl > We lined up gingerly . < nl >  Elva ,  she said ,  One , two , three ... Come on , she can do this , one more ... Yes ! Four . Well done .  < nl >  Charlotte , come on up , do n't be shy . One , two , three , four , five , six ! Great job .  < nl >  Emma .  < nl > she walked up to the bar . she was just a bit too short and had to tip her toes to reach it . As soon as she began to pull , her arms felt like they had been injected with the world 's most potent hot sauce . she could imagine the muscle fibres , burning , tearing . The sun stung sharply into her skin . < nl >  she , she can do this . she believe in she .  she said . < nl > she let go . < nl >  Do n't give up . Try again . Come on !  she said ,  In all her years of teaching she have never seen someone fail to do a chin - up .  < nl >  she do n't get it . she 's * special * !  ProtagonistD said , with ProtagonistD's usual impeccable smile . Oh , how she hated that smile . < nl > her face fell .  Do n't worry , we can assign she to the special PE class . There 's nothing to be afraid of .  < nl > * * * < nl > Being in the special PE class meant no one would sit with you at lunch . It meant your friends would n't be your friends anymore . It meant ProtagonistD would find you at your weakest moment and break you further . < nl >  she 're a freak just like ProtagonistE !  ProtagonistD had said to she at lunch , just after that dreaded PE class . < nl > A teacher overheard ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistD must never , never say that to another person . Apologize . Now .  < nl >  ProtagonistD 'm sorry .  ProtagonistD said . Who could overlook ProtagonistD's innocent smile and think ProtagonistD was being insincere ? < nl > But she knew ProtagonistD was n't . she could tell . she just knew . < nl > To be honest , she did n't understand why ProtagonistF fell for ProtagonistE back then . ProtagonistF came from a well - positioned family , was good looking , smart and genetically enhanced for a long life . ProtagonistE was a scrawny kid who wore clothes two sizes too big because it was the only size ProtagonistE could find , and ProtagonistE did n't have any modifications either . < nl > It would n't be until high school when she would find out . < nl > * * * < nl > High school was different . Classes were sorted based on the genetic modifications you received . But they did n't know what to do with she , so they just shoved she in whatever random class they pleased . she was the girl no one wanted to deal with . < nl > But the classes all assumed prior abilities from your modifications . It was simply the norm . As a result , she was never the model student in class , always catching up . she dreaded the day when grades would come out . No , not because of Mom , who 'd been too depressed to care ever since ProtagonistE died , ironically , from cancer caused by one of ProtagonistE's genes that could 've been modified when ProtagonistE was born . No , she feared the day because of ProtagonistD . < nl > * * * < nl > It came anyway . < nl >  ProtagonistD did n't know how someone can be ugly and dumb at the same time . she really * are * special .  ProtagonistD said . ProtagonistD's gang all laughed at ProtagonistD's joke . It was a weak joke and they knew it . They just needed someone to laugh at . < nl >  You know , ProtagonistE deserved to die . It 's called * evolution * . Look it up , if ProtagonistD could even understand it .  ProtagonistD's friend erupted in laughter again . < nl > Too far . Way too far . < nl > her hands forming a fist , reaching out . ProtagonistD jumped back . ProtagonistD was too fast and ProtagonistD's reaction time unhuman , thanks to ProtagonistD's modifications . < nl >  So she wanna fight , huh ? Come at ProtagonistD . Come on .  ProtagonistD said , knowing she was n't as strong as ProtagonistD . < nl > her mind raced . * she 'd never win against ProtagonistD in a fair fight , she know that . What should she do ? What would ProtagonistD do ? ProtagonistD would come charging straight at she , would n't ProtagonistD ? Yes . That 's what ProtagonistD 'd do . And ProtagonistD would n't look down either , no , ProtagonistD would n't . * < nl > she tensed , sticking out her foot at the right moment as ProtagonistD fell to the ground . What she did n't expect was how quickly ProtagonistD 'd get up . < nl > * * * < nl > On that night she walked home covered in purple bruises . As she opened the door she saw ProtagonistF's mouth open . < nl >  My God , what happened to she ? she ... she ...  < nl >  ProtagonistF , why did ProtagonistF choose ProtagonistE ? Why not anyone else ?  < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistF told ProtagonistE this day would come . ProtagonistF told ProtagonistE and ProtagonistE told ProtagonistF to show she something . Come .  ProtagonistF led she upstairs to ProtagonistF's room . < nl >  Here .  ProtagonistF handed she an article . Printed , marked with small letters on the margins . ProtagonistE's handwriting . A passage was highlighted in yellow . < nl > > Without a doubt , genetic editing had done a great service to mankind . However , it is not without its downsides . First and foremost , we possess the technology necessary to enhance certain traits by a large degree . While this helps to cement the trait , it also interferes with the person 's natural development , as the trait is too concrete in his or her genetic code for the individual to go against it , making the individual extremely predictable . Secondly , it is understood that the genetic code does not work on a basis of traits . Changing one trait may result in another trait being inadvertently changed in the process , leading to side effects to every modification known to man ... < nl > she saw ProtagonistF wipe away at a tear .  It 's okay .  she said .  she 'm okay .  < nl > * * * < nl > It had been a while since ProtagonistD had pestered she . ProtagonistD seemed to have a lot more respect after she tripped ProtagonistD . No , not respect , but fear . < nl > At lunch , she sat alone , researching genetic modifications on her tablet . It was fascinating . she 've been researching for the last twelve days and she was still learning new things . < nl > she being silent seemed to trick ProtagonistD into a sense of security . she heard those familiar footsteps , saw that familiar smile .  Hey she , how 's it going ?  ProtagonistD said , snatching her tablet away . < nl >  Oh , look guys , it looks like she wants to be pretty ! Well , guess what , too bad .  ProtagonistD showed ProtagonistD's friends as they laughed . < nl > she was laughing too , on the inside . Because she could guess the modifications ProtagonistD received . And out of those , she knew ProtagonistD had three important modifications : IN-2 , which causes a lack of awareness of the surrounding environment , CH-7 , which reduces critical thinking , and ST-5 , which causes a person to follow instructions blindly . < nl > ProtagonistD would n't be laughing after ProtagonistD suddenly finds ProtagonistD having walked into the principal 's office . < eos > 
< sos >  The Antichrist !  Alice said and clacked her hooves together .  It 's finally time !  < nl > Carol rolled her eyes , her tattered black wings slouching on she back .  That 's your solution for everything , is n't it ? Just rain chaos upon the world .  < nl >  That 's hardly fair - the apocalypse takes planning , precision ... finesse . * Finesse * !  The fires flared to emphasize her words .  Chaos implicates randomness - this is far from it . Seriously , she do n't get why you guys do n't want to try * Revelation ... *  < nl >  While the end of the world would certainly get people 's attention , it would also mean the end of all amusement ,  said the Devil absently , busy polishing his horns .  What we need is something ingenious ... something * fiendish . * I suggest dream visitation ... nightmares ... deceit ... trickery ... bring them all down here ... then we can tell them in person !  < nl >  That 's weak !  she roared .  she hate weak ! she want to see things burning !  < nl > The Ninth Circle fell silent for a while , save for the pathetic whimpering of the poor souls stuck in the ice . she tilted her head to the side , regarding the others . she did n't deserve to be here like the other two - even after all these years , it felt unjust . Breaking out had always been her number one priority . she knew now that she could n't do it alone , and getting these two in the same room had n't been easy . < nl >  Listen ,  she finally said and took a few nimble steps up to the brimstone table ,  if we do n't work together we 'll get nowhere . We want out , and we want to show them we 're not the same person - those are our goals .  < nl > The Devil put his glass to his red lips and swirled the liquid in his mouth .  I still have n't heard her plan .  < nl >  There 's no * she * ; there 's only * ours * . And right now we 've got squat .  < nl > The Devil flipped a cigarette between his claws .  Well ... there 's something I have n't told you before ; I actually know the way out of here . But we still need to come up with a way to distinguish ourselves .  < nl >  What the hell did you just say ?  she rose to her full height , her silhouette crackling with flames . < nl > she crossed her arms and looked darkly at the Devil . < nl >  While you 've been tempting people and giving them false promises ... and while she 's been stomping around , causing havoc , she 've been extracting information from our dear population ... she can get us out , but you need to tell she how we 're going to make people see us for who we really are .  < nl >  This is unacceptable ! she could 've blown things up a long time ago !  she said , her voice quaking .  And to think that all this time she had her sympathy ... The Rolling Stones actually had she fooled ! SAD .  < nl > she made her way over to the Devil and put her lips to his ear .  Is there any way we can leave she here ?  < nl >  Sorry , she . Opening the portal requires all three of us . Now , do she have a plan or not ?  < nl >  Fine ,  she said .  Here 's her idea . We 'll take on the guise of powerful people . And through them , we 'll present ourselves as different individuals . We wo n't be our mythological selves ... but our ideals will remain the same .  < nl >  It could work ,  the Devil said . < nl >  Yes !  she rumbled .  Let 's go already !  < nl >  What 's my name ?  the Devil sang . < nl >  Putin .  < nl >  What 's her name ?  she said . < nl >  Trump .  < nl >  And yours ?  they both said at the same time . < nl >  Please allow me to introduce myself ; I 'm a man of wealth and taste ...  she sang along .  My name is Elon Musk .  < eos > 
< sos > They had made up names for Alice .  The Grim Reaper  was her favorite ; that one came with its own mythology . The story went that when it was a human 's time to go , they 'd see manifestations of she , coming to collect their souls and escort them to the afterlife . The black robe and scythe had become very much a part of her iconography , and she had embraced that . In reality , the scythe was the favored weapon of her people , and the black robe just made she feel cool . Humans knew , of course , that it was logically impossible for she to collect * every * dying human soul , but they ascribed that to the supernatural , something they tended to do with most things they did n't have the capacity to explain . < nl > The truth was that human souls were delicious . The mundanity of the real reason she was hunting that day was almost funny to she . she spent most of her time on Earth , though occasionally she would share her kill with her brothers and sisters throughout the galaxy . < nl > Tonight , she found she in a city that humans called Oss - tin . It was   quite a lively city , and it was a night that saw the streets of Oss - tin flooded with people . she scanned the street from atop a roof , assessing the richness of the feast of souls set out before she . Humans were mostly frail , but in large groups , they could wreak havoc on she . she needed to choose carefully . < nl > Carol stumbled out of a bar , filled with the libations that she understood this part of the city was famous for . her aura glowed brightly . < nl > she was ripe . < nl > she waved a hand in front of her face , transforming what would be a ghastly appearance to any human into a pleasant , charming face . The idea was to lure she into one of Oss - tin 's many alleys and side streets , striking she down while she was alone . she jumped down from the roof , landing in the roaring crowd without making a sound . < nl > she marched right up to she . she was going to be sick . she moved out of her way just in time to watch she expel the contents of her stomach out onto the street . A hand flew to her mouth to keep she from laughing . she reached out to she . < nl >  Let she give she a hand .  she looked up at she , immediately taken with her new guise , and slurred some form of assent . she draped her arm over her shoulder , guiding she to the alley beside the bar she 'd just fallen out of . Once she had determined they were sufficiently alone , her disguise dissipated . her face went completely white . < nl >  Oh , god . Oh , shit . Is this it ?  < nl > she nodded .  This is it . she can carry a message to her family , if she 'd like .  she would do no such thing , but it typically calmed down her prey enough to make her job easy . < nl >  Just ... just tell her parents she love them , and sorry she 'm such a fuck - up ...  she let out a choking sob , putting her head in her hands . her heart fell . she always felt bad if they started crying . But she had a job to do . < nl >  she 'll tell them . Now kneel .  she did as she was told , and she raised her scythe , bringing it down on her neck . No cut was made , though a white mist began to seep from her body . she opened a pouch she was carrying inside her robe to collect it . The soul was rich in nutrients . < nl > she had done well . < eos > 
< sos > The last of the wooden planks was hammered into place as Alice dabbed at her brow with the rags hanging from her neck . It was hardly what one could call a temple . she had fashioned the crude wooden shrine she , carving and hammering the planks and poles with as much care as she could muster . Still , it looked unimpressive . The edges jutted out awkwardly , the pillars were uneven , and it had no fanciful decorations that one might expect at a proper shrine or temple . No garland of flowers hung from the flat roof of the shrine , no incense smoke trailed into the sky , and no prayers or prophecies were chanted . Most conspicuously , the spot where the idol of the god would sit- in the centre of the shrine- was empty . If this was a temple , it provided no clue as to which god it was meant for . < nl > And yet she was content , eager even . she had left the shrine unfurnished on purpose . Each temple or shrine was a home for a god , a resting place for the otherworldly , powerful beings that governed the laws of nature and weaved human fates with their fingertips . It was said that those who built these sanctuaries would receive a blessing from whichever god decided to take up residence there . Now , she simply hoped that there would be a deity willing to possess the modest temple that she 'd created . As she ambled off to sleep , she prayed for a suitable god or goddess- Demeter , maybe- to bless she , with bountiful harvests for the rest of her days . < nl > The next day , she gingerly placed a bowl of rice in front of the shrine and knelt down . Unsure of what else to do , she mumbled  Gods or goddesses that be , please accept this humble sacrifice ,  and waited . A moment passed . she chuckled to she . Of course , no god would be willing to resign themselves to such a shabby place of worship . she 'd long been prepared for that outcome . she began to rise to her feet . < nl > Then she heard it . she had to strain to make it out , but it sounded like someone was speaking to she . A faint voice , coming from the rickety wooden altar that she 'd fashioned . The voice was quiet , and sounded almost weak .  Child ,  it said ,  Thank you for the offering . Carol 'm afraid she ca n't do much for you now , but come back tomorrow . Perhaps then , she might be able to reward you .  < nl > her eyes opened wide , as she almost fell over from surprise . she 'd never spoken to a god before . And yet , it was different from what she 'd expected . Were n't the gods meant to be mighty ? Powerful ? Then what was this tinny voice coming from the shrine ? she pushed the invasive thoughts out of her mind . A god was a god , and it was best not to think disrespectful thoughts in front of them . she bowed deeply , and vowed to bring a better offering the next morning . < nl > This time , there was a bowl of rice , accompanied by a dish of meat and a glass of wine .  Gods or goddesses that be ,  she repeated ,  Please accept this humble sacrifice .  < nl > The voice that echoed out from the shrine was clearer than the day before , and she could now ascertain that it sounded female . A goddess ?  Thank you , child . It has been a long , long time since she have received an offering , and she was forced into hibernation until you sacrificed to she . she ca n't seem to remember who she am ; but she remember Elva . her name was ... Demeter ? she am sorry child , if you do n't mind coming back tomorrow , perhaps she will have regained enough strength to remember by identity .  < nl > Excitement thrilled through her veins . A goddess related to she ? Perhaps her simple wish really would come true , and she 'd see bountiful harvests for the rest of her days . she quelled her exhilaration , and waited patiently for the next morning . < nl > As usual , she left the sacrifice in front of the altar , and knelt down . The voice manifested once again , this time even clearer than before .  Child , she have remembered ,  she spoke . It was good news . *  Yet she does not sound happy ,  * she thought to she silently . her voice was quavering slightly . Rage ? No , nothing like that . she sounded melancholic , almost , as if she had recalled something she would much rather have forgotten . < nl >  her name is Limos ,  she said .  Child , thank you for the offerings . But she must go now .  < nl >  Why ?  she cried ,  Oh but she , she 've barely arrived ! Stay a while , at least , and wo n't she let her crops grow well ? she wo n't ask for a lifetime of bountiful harvest , but would she at least help she this season ?  < nl > Though she could not see she , she felt she shake her head , almost imperceptibly . And then , she was gone . < nl > Even when she brought the offerings the next morning , and the days after that , she never returned . < nl > * * * * * < nl > she faded away from the shrine , cutting away her attachment from the temple that she had built . she shut her eyes , and prepared to sleep again . This time , she did n't know when she would wake up . The faintest tear trickled down her face before dissipating into a hazy light . she had been so happy when a mortal had called she , worshiped she , given her offerings . It had been so long , after all . But then she 'd remembered who she was , * what * she was . < nl > she Looking at she , she knew that she could not stay . That was her fate : she would only ever bring disaster to those who called she . she would be spurned , hated , cursed , and ultimately- forgotten . < nl > As her consciousness faded away , she saw the faint image of a man kneeling in front of a clumsy , wooden shrine , food and wine in his outstretched hands . < nl > * * * * * < nl > * I write a story a day [ here](http://yearofpilgrimage.wordpress.com ) * < nl > * more stories at /r / chasing_mist * < eos > 
< sos > Alice struggled against the chains , her naked body cold with sweat , her eyes burning in feverish despair . The blindfold was soaked in her tears . she heard them chant darkly around she . she had seen the knife , the chalice , the circle of candles , and the pentagram on the floor . she tried to scream but the foul - tasting gag muffled she . < nl > Only this morning she had prepared she for her first day of high school . she was ready to meet her new classmates - ready , but nervous . she had heard the van drive up behind she . she remembered thinking nothing of it . And then it was just blackness . < nl > she gasped as she felt cold steel run down her thigh , and then the sting . Wet heat seeped down her skin . < nl >  Oh , Dark One !  A deep voice said in maniacal ecstasy .  We offer you the blood of she ! Step forth !   Join us on this mortal plane . Take your throne ! The world is yours .  < nl > At first , there was nothing , but then the room shook . she could smell the mortar dust sailing down from the ceiling . her stomach felt like she was on a roller coaster . Strange smells filled her nostrils . Charcoal , rotten eggs , and melting iron . Then there was heat . < nl > ' * Open her eyes , * ' Carol whispered in the back of her mind . < nl > she took a deep breath . she could feel the heat on her lips and in her throat . she was no longer gagged . she sat up and opened her eyes . < nl > The landscape before she was a waste of ashes and darkened mountains . Like the neon signs of an amusement park , rivers of flowing lava lit up the night . What the hell ... < nl > ' * That 's right . That 's exactly it . * ' < nl > she shook her head trying to rid she of the strange whispers , and at the same time make sense of her surroundings . The ground beneath her rumbled . In the far distance , a red flower bloomed over a mountain , and then the rock started bleeding . < nl >  Where am she ?  she said , despite she . < nl > her voice was twisted and dark and sent a shiver down her own spine . It was n't her voice . < nl > ' * she 're in Hell , she . * ' < nl >  Who are you ? Am she dead ?  < nl > she let out a hushed chuckle . < nl > ' * Listen , she . Allow me to take her soul , and I 'll put she right back in her world . * ' < nl > she thought about her parents and her little sister ; she did want to see them again . This place was dead ; there was nothing for she here . Still , the room with the crazed cultists flickered in her mind . she had been so scared . she did n't want to go back to that . < nl > ' * What are she going to do , huh ? * ' she said . ' * There 's nothing for she here . * ' < nl >  How do she know that ?  she growled , trying to stay unfazed by her she .  she 've only just got here .  < nl > ' * she can trust me , I 've been here for a very long time . There 's nothing but brimstone and suffering here . * ' < nl >  Are you Lucifer ?  < nl > she laughed in the back of her mind but did n't respond . she looked at her hand . It was covered in red scales with claws sprouting from her fingertips . Carefully , she touched her face . her nose had a strange shape , almost like a snout , and when she moved her head around it felt heavy . < nl >  You 're not getting her soul until you tell she what 's going on .  < nl > ' * That little cult tried to summon she - it happens . But they were clever this time , very ... * * * specific * * * about what she could and could n't do . she was supposed to be bound to your mortal form ... they wanted power over she . They were clever . she 'll give them that . But there is always a loophole . she reversed the ritual , and now you 're here . You possess she . * ' < nl >  I possess she ?  < nl > ' * Yes , quite ironic is n't it ? she kind of enjoy having you in there though ... it 's refreshing . But she like she said , she can send you back ... at the cost of her soul , of course . * ' < nl >  Nope .  < nl > she snorted . ' * What do she mean , ' nope ? ' * ' < nl >  she lied . You 're not getting her soul .  < nl > she took a few steps . her feet were massive hooves and the ground puffed ash . she left a trail of burning hoof prints in her wake . < nl > ' * I like she . * ' she carried a combination of anger and stark amusement . < nl >  she do n't care ,  she said and tried out the massive wings on her back . < nl > she wanted to get back home , but maybe she could enjoy she for a while first . she 'd always wanted to fly . < nl > ' * The only way back ... is you giving me your soul . * ' < nl >  she do n't know . If you got in here somehow , there has to be a way out .  < nl > Now she went into full - blown laughter . < nl >  What ? It 's only logical .  < nl > ' * There is a way out . she 'll show it to she . * ' < nl >  And what , the price is her freaking soul ?  < nl > ' * Oh no , this one is on the house . Maybe then she 'll better grasp the concept of eternal damnation . * ' < nl >  Whatever . Just tell she where it is ,  she said and rolled her eyes . < nl > ' * Follow the stream . * ' < nl >  Which one ?  < nl > ' * Any . They all lead to the same place . * ' < nl > * * * < nl > she stomped along the dead plains , following a smoldering river . she tried to fly a few times , but her lack of coordination made her crash . she 'd always been a bit clumsy , and piloting this body was much harder than her own . < nl > Finally , she reached the foot of a massive volcano . Lava boiled down its sides , spreading into a burning spider web over the strange landscape . she took a deep breath and tried to control her limbs . Arms . Legs . Tail . Wings . Lots of things to keep track of . Kind of like operating one of her dad 's excavators . < nl > her massive thighs strained , and she somehow managed to push she off the ground , catching she with the big wings . she flapped them desperately , and somehow she rose . < nl > ' * Not bad , * ' she said . < nl > After a bit of a struggle , she managed to gain some sort of control . The massive body drifted through the air . she felt her mouth twist into a toothy grin . But as much as she enjoyed the tingly sensation in the pit of her scaly stomach , she wanted to get back home . < nl > Landing on the rim of the volcano 's top was far from easy . she crashed inelegantly into a heap . she 'd have to practice that . < nl > The interior of the mountain was a massive red lake . < nl > ' * This is where we put some of the sinners , * ' she said and chuckled . ' * Swim across , she , swim across ! They never make it very far . * ' < nl > she noticed tiny black dots right below she . They were all people , screaming and trying to claw their way out . < nl >  So , how do she get out ?  she said , trying to keep her voice steady . < nl > ' * At the middle . * ' < nl > she was n't super excited about flying over an open lake of lava , but she still jumped into the air . It went better this time . Gliding across the screaming billions , she saw a dark shape jutting out of all the red , like a small leaf floating in a bowl of tomato soup . < nl > Elva sat cross - legged and naked on the steaming rock . < nl >  Hey , who are she ?  she said , landing with a thud ,  and how do she get out of here ?  < nl > she lifted her graying head . her eyes were clogged with ashes , and her lips black and chapped . For a moment , she appeared scared , but then she tilted her head to the side . < nl >  she 're ... new ,  she muttered .  Have she come to torture she ?  < nl >  No , she want to leave ! Which way is out ?  < nl >  Are she sure ?  < nl >  Yes !  < nl >  Okay ...  she spread her filthy fingers into a claw , and grated them over the sharp rocks , cringing from the pain . < nl > A trail of bubbling blood soon formed a circle on the ground . she shook her head . < nl >  Just step into the circle ,  she mumbled . < nl > she was about to do as she was told , but then a thought struck she . she did n't deserve to suffer here after being so helpful . she was going to bring she along . And with a flick of her massive wrist , she snatched she up . she let out a shrill scream of horror , kicking and wriggling to get free . < nl >  Let 's go home ,  she said and stepped into the glowing circle . < nl > she felt the air pulsating around she , and a strange pressure pushed on her shoulders . < nl > ' * I lied too , * ' the voice inside her head said and laughed . ' * There 's only down from here . * ' < nl > * * * < nl > r / Lilwa_Dexel < eos > 
< sos > * Emergence * < nl > ' Location unknown . Location unknown . Location unknown , ' the traversal shuttle 's intercom announced again and again in its warm , clipped tones as a warning light repeatedly bathed the cabin in crimson light . < nl > Alice breathed out , closing her eyes and clenching her fists as she endured the last waves of traversal shock . The mindless iteration of evolution had never anticipated humanity would leave its cradle , let alone transmit itself nigh - instantaneously across the cosmos . Traversal , then , the means with which homo sapiens had made a laughing stock of the vastness of the void , was something the biological brain was singularly discomforted by . < nl > Black , abyssal depths , condensed nebulae clouds and frozen suns hanging in a paralyzed cosmos were the sights available to anyone stupid enough to look out of a viewport mid - traversal . The visions of a creationist God , democratised all the way down to family tourism and long haul work commutes . < nl > she opened her eyes for a brief moment , long enough to experience pure agony as the strobing light bloomed directly in front of her face . she snarled , punching out blindly with the armoured knuckles of her voidskin and being rewarded with the sharp * crack * of plastic . < nl > ' Passenger consciousness detected , ' the capsule 's voice intoned , ' please remain calm . Location is unknown . Manual input requested . ' There was a faint click as a screen dropped into her vision , emerging seamlessly from the featureless black of the capsule 's interior . < nl > ' she suppose she do n't get a discount for teaching the capsule what a planet looks like ? ' she asked sarcastically , idly waving at the screen to activate it . Most corporate capsules were the same . Dumb . Drop out of traversal sideways and then ask the passenger what the destination should look like levels of dumb . < nl > The screen blinked on , briefly displayed the skull and crossed missiles of some two bit shipping firm , then clicked into an endless cascade of flashing red astronomic errors . Dozens , then hundreds , then thousands . All pointing to one lunatic impossibility , laid out in stark characters before her eyes . < nl > The stars had moved . < nl > she swallowed a searing , panicked breath and pushed her restraint - seat away from the glaring screen . The capsule 's primary viewport was a small circle of hardened armourglass to her left , flickering with intermittent flashes of light from the void outside . < nl > her voidskin detected the adrenaline rush as she stared at the planet below and reacted automatically , sprouting an armoured double - layer of interlocking plates from its matte black surface . she scarcely noticed . her face was locked in a crazed rictus , a slight twitch to her eyes , all blood fled to leave she utterly pale . < nl > A thousand thousand unknown ships , bearing symbols in no human language , hanging in an inhuman sky . < nl > ( Fun little exercise , but she 'm at work so she 'll stop . ) < eos > 
< sos > The President of the United States , who was - at that time - a rather sensible lady who wore sensible shoes and did sensible things like Wednesday morning yoga and not killing poor people , had just taken up a phone call with Alice . < nl > They were supposed to be talking about Iceland , which had gotten rather full of itself on account of sounding like a dreary place but actually being quite a lovely place . In those days it was encouraged that you acted how everyone suspected you should act , and not be clever and full of natural hot springs and other such nonsense . In fact , here was a good example of that - as news came in just as the call began that Australia had gone and done something almost unreasonably Australian . < nl >  Is that so ?  said she , upon hearing the news that Australia - as a continent - had flown off into the inky depths of space to face down an invading alien force .  Were they pissed , d'ya think ?  < nl >  When are they not ?  said she .  Always running around , punching kangaroos and drinking Fosters .... which is a ... *beer * , she believe ?  < nl >  Aye , she ,  said she .  Supposedly .  < nl >  Well , she 'd know them better than she ,  said she .  Do she think they 'll win ?  < nl >  Certainly - they 've got English blood in their DNA ,  said she . < nl >  she 'm not sure that 's how DNA works ,  said she , leaning back in her chair to stare up at the blue sky . she thought , perhaps , just perhaps , she could spot a black speck in the distance .  Better question might be , when did they turn their continent into a spaceship ? That 's not exactly a weekend project .  < nl > she belched , then lowered the phone and cussed out Glinda , who was supposed to be taking orders , but was just talking on her cellphone . Carol nodded .  Who 're talkin ' to * now * ?  she asked . < nl >  None'r'ya fuck all ,  snapped she , tossing back and forth a volley of rude gestures with she before picking up the phone .  Who can understand the mind of an Aussie ? They have spiders with thumbs there , d'ya know that ? Drive anyone insane .  < nl > she clucked her tongue .  she do n't suppose they were planning on invading , do she ?  < nl >  Invading what ?  < nl >  You . Or us . Maybe Iceland ...  < nl >  Nah ,  said she .  she overthinking again , she . There 's no sense to anything to do with the Aussies . You ever seen the giant Banana - person show ? Who 's * that * for ? Elva , that 's who . she turned the whole place into a warship because that seemed like the thing to do at the time . she flew off inta space because it seemed like a laugh . she 'll either die , or win , or make a bunch of new alien mates up there , then she 'll come back , have a nice nap , little hair of the dog , and it 's back to boogieboards and flying snakes and whatever the fuck else happens in that beautiful hellhole .  < nl > she was snapping her fingers and Glinda was nowhere to be seen .  she suppose we 'll take up on Iceland another time , eh she ?  < nl >  she suppose ,  said she , still troubled .  You know she always appreciate her wise counsel .  < nl >  Aye ,  said she .  Fucking Yoda over here .  < nl > she smiled , then hung up the phone . she would just have to wait . That was all . The Australians would do as the Australians would do . All she could do was have faith . < nl > ProtagonistD , had been standing inside the door the entire time , waiting patiently . < nl >  Yes , ProtagonistD ,  said she .  Let me guess - the Defense Secretary wants an emergency trillion dollars for intergalactic cruise missiles ? Am I close ?  < nl > ProtagonistD's head went slightly sideways .  Ah , a * little * ? Just wanted to let she know that New Zealand , Papua New Guinea , and Indonesia have all been ... uh ... incinerated .  < nl >  Oh my god !  cried she , rising from her chair .  The aliens attacked ? Already ? I thought ...  < nl >  No , no ,  said ProtagonistD .  It 's uh ... ProtagonistD guess it take a lot of * thrust * to break an entire continent out of orbit .  < nl > she slowly sank back down .  Oh .  < nl >  Yeah ,  said ProtagonistD .  We 've got massive tsunamis heading toward Hawaii and all across southeast Asia .  < nl >  Oh .  < nl >  Right .  < nl >  So ... this was * not * a good idea ?  < nl > ProtagonistD nodded .  It ... does not appear to have been .  < nl >  Well ,  said she , turning back toward the window .  Lesson for the future , she guess . Do n't turn continents into spaceships .  < nl >  ProtagonistD 'll write that down somewhere ,  said ProtagonistD , letting ProtagonistD out of the room . < nl > she could swear she could see that speck on the horizon .  ProtagonistD do that .  < eos > 
< sos > The first flecks of dawn 's light trickled into the fancy high - rise bar . All was quiet except for the subtle squeaking of glasses being cleaned by Alice . she worked mechanically , with no life in her movements . she did n't even flinch as the rear door slammed open and noise flooded the room . < nl > A terrifying assortment of gruesome creatures poured into the bar from the door as though through the gates of hell itself accompanied by a cacophony of growls , hisses , and moans that one could almost mistake as laughter . A towering figure with twisting horns and cruel claws approached the counter first , gingerly taking a seat and smiling at she with a mouth of wickedly pointed teeth . < nl >  Mornin ' she ! We had a great night , a round for everyone on me !  the monster proclaimed to cheers from his comrades . < nl >  Coming right up Carol ,  she said quietly , moving to fill the order without a hint of fear , or any other emotion for that matter . < nl > her smile faltered as she looked at she curiously , noticing the tear streaks leading from her dead brown eyes . < nl >  Hey hey ,  she said , her voice now as gentle as it could be with its rumbling timbre .  There 's something eating she she . What 's wrong ? Can we help ?  < nl > The bar quieted as the others began noticing her distress . It seemed for a moment that she would remain quiet , but soon she opened up , her voice quivering .  she - she ... It 's her kids . Some people took them . They 're demanding a ten million dollar ransom delivered to them somewhere in that old abandoned neighborhood down Hollis St within a day if she ever want to see her kids again . They said they 'd disappear if they saw even a hint of the police . her husband is out trying to see if we can even get a loan that big . We do n't even have anything close to that kind of money ! Why she ? What can she do ! ?  she had thought she cried out , but found new tears forming as she let it out . < nl > The shocking assortment of creatures looked at one another in shock , each wondering who could be so cruel . she leaned over the counter and grabbed she in a bear hug that she melted into eagerly . After a moment she released she , leaning back with a dangerous gleam in her eyes . < nl >  Fella 's , looks like that drink will have to wait , we 've got overtime to do .  she said as she began stomping towards the door they had entered through . < nl > she looked after she in surprise ,  what are she going to do ?  < nl > she paused , looking back at she with a gentle fierceness ,  what we do best . Find those kids .  < nl > ---------- < nl > Elva leaned against the wall of the shabby house twirling a butterfly knife with boredom . she glanced over at the two kids tied in the corner , reassuring she they were still here . By the terror on their faces , she could tell they should n't be a problem , but she really needed this to go smoothly . Hopefully she would n't do anything stupid like bring in the police , then they 'd never have their payday , and she might have to deal with those kids which would be unpleasant . < nl > ProtagonistD , looked up at she nervously ,  she , are she sure she 's good for it ? This is an awful risk . What if she has mob connections ?  < nl > she rolled her eyes at ProtagonistD .  Of course she is idiot . That bar of she is fancy as hell , but it 's practically never open , it 's definitely a front for something . Plus , she 's way too squeaky clean to be with the mob . No , this is some white collar shady business . That kind of money is probably pocket change to she . We 'll get our payout and disappear to some quiet island somewhere , just chill out .  < nl > ProtagonistD shifted nervously ,  if she say so . Something about all this just gives ProtagonistD a bad feeling .  < nl >  Oh so ProtagonistD 're a jedi now ? Shut it and keep watch , this will be over soon ,  she snapped at ProtagonistD . < nl > she glanced back at the kids and saw them still where she 'd left them . Had that closet door been cracked before ? Probably , maybe she was a little jumpy after all . she grinned to she . With the creaking of this old building she could almost imagine they were footsteps behind she and that those shadows in the corners were alive . < nl > she squinted . Hold on , did that shadow just move ? < nl > Before she could take another breath , the room exploded into motion around she . she saw shadows move for sure this time . Scales , claws , tentacles , feathers , slime , fur , horns , and teeth were all in a sudden whirlwind about she as she was hit from multiple angles at once . In an instant she was on her back in tremendous pain and with the breath knocked out of she . Leaning over she was a terrifying visage of twisted horns , wicked teeth , and blue fur leering at she with eyes in which she could see her death reflected . she tried to let out what would have been the most primal scream of terror of her life , but there was no air in her lungs to release . < nl > The figure spoke in a quiet growl that sent shivers down her spine .  she are lucky we do n't kill anyone these days , but if she ever think of hurting a child again , I 'll make an exception for she . We can find she no matter where she run . Nowhere is safe from us .  < nl > she thought she could hear sirens in the distance and her head fell to the side as she began to lose consciousness from terror , shock , and lack of air . The last thing she saw was the kids , now unbound , hugging a huge green eyeball . < nl > ----------- < nl > she looked up from the bar to twin shrieks of joy proclaiming ,  she ! !  < nl > she embraced her children fiercely as they ran to she , tears of relief and joy spilling down her cheeks , for the moment paying no heed to the menagerie of monsters filing in from the broom closet . < nl > After a while she stood and beckoned to she ,  come here she .  < nl > The two shared an embrace and she whispered to she ,  thanks she .  < nl >  Anything for she she ,  she said warmly . < nl > she stepped back and smiled at the gathered crowd , then walked around behind the bar again .  Thank you all so much . Order up , Monsters Inc drinks free today !  < eos > 
< sos > Deep in the wood sat a cabin glowing like a candle in the darkness . The wind clutched at it , rattled the windows as if begging to come inside . But the windows stayed shut , and the house did not fall . < nl > Inside , Alice and Carol sat up late , reading books . < nl > Every longing sigh of the wind drew her eyes once more to the windows . To the shapes she imagined pacing out there beyond the safe halo of light . But she could see only the drawn curtain . If she moved it there would be only her own reflection , pooling back at she , unless she was brave enough to put her nose right to the glass and squint out . < nl > she told her stories about the things out there . she did not need to see them to believe she . she knew them by their three - clawed prints that circled their home like a moat every morning . By the gouges bored into the hide of her woodshed , deeper than any bear 's mark . < nl > she caught she staring .  What have she always told she , she ?  she stared mutely at the book until she answered for she ,  When the lights are on , we 're safe .  < nl > she gestured to the unflinching pupil of the light above , her smile easy and light .  As she can see ,  she said ,  we 're safe .  < nl > she hid her face in her arm . she had lived eight years under the watchful guard of sunlight and filament . Darkness was nothingness . Darkness was death . < nl > So when she woke that night to a pitch - black room , she began to shriek . A hand stifled she . her hand . her other gripped her wrist tightly , as if she was trying to tell she something through her very bones .  she 'm going to go try the generator .  < nl >  But--  she said into her fingertips . < nl > she shook her head .  It should have turned on , and it did n't .  < nl > The wind rattled at the roof like an angry god . < nl >  Someone has to go check it ,  she whispered , gently . Then she moved away , taking all the warmth and her fleeting calm with she . she bolted upright in bed , unsure if she should flee or hide . < nl > * Surely they know we 're in here * , she wanted to ask , but she could not give the life to the possibility by saying it aloud . < nl > she tossed a bundle at she .  Get dressed . Be silent . she love she .  she looked once over her shoulder , at the flashlight beside the door . she handed it to she .  If they come inside , use this .  < nl > And then she opened the door . Blackness opening into blackness , broken only by a scattering of stars . Night quiet as perfect and unbroken as new snow . she looked back at she as she let the door shut behind she . < nl > she shoved her fist into her mouth to keep from sobbing . she had never seen a night so complete . < nl > Without the light , there was nothing to keep the monsters away . < nl > she scrambled to her feet . As soundlessly as she could she wriggled into her two warmest leggings and threw on her largest pair of jeans over it . Sweaters , snow pants , socks thick as her pinky . The mittens she knitted for she that summer while she watched her needles click and the butterflies flitter and-- < nl > And a crunching , out there , beyond the door . A scuffle in the snow . < nl > she jammed her feet into her boots . she told she it was she . Had to be only her father , panicked , in the dark . < nl > A howl shattered the night like dropped glass . A great bellow from beyond the pines , deep as the earth and older still . Another joined it , and another . Their calls were urgent , and coming closer . < nl > she threw she down instantly , unthinkingly , as if trying to make she invisible . And she froze there , rabbit in a burrow , listening . Stilling her very heart . < nl > And then the creatures in the darkness went silent . There was only the cry of the wind , and faintly beneath it , the whine of the generator , as she struggled to make it go . < nl > she crawled on elbows and knees to the windows . The heavy plaid curtains were lashed together . she raised a shuddering hand to untie them . Scooted the corner back just far enough to peer around the corner . < nl > A pair of yellow eyes in a sea of matted black fur stared back at she , widened in delight when they met she . Its head was something between a wolf and a bear , but its eyes watched she knowingly , cleverly . As if it were waiting for she to look out and notice it . < nl > she tumbled back shrieking . < nl > The lights flared back to life overhead . < nl > And outside , she started screaming . < nl > she did not think . she ran to the bed and seized her huge emergency flashlight . Stumbled into night for the first time in her life . < nl > A hoard of black - coated creatures swarmed her shed . Their teeth caught and gleamed in the light of the moon . One had she by the leg < nl > The outside lights were still dead . she fumbled with the flashlight , wrenched off a mitten , and flicked it on . Swung the beam toward the writhing mass of shapes . Smoke rose off their skin . They scattered screaming and hissing off she like water dropped in hot oil . she lay limp in the light , the snow around she a damp , churned scarlet . < nl > The night - creatures circled she like lions . One nipped at the toe of her boot . < nl > she flicked the light toward it , and the creature scrambled backward . < nl > Panning the light in front of she , she stepped into her footsteps , toward the pack of nightmares that watched snarling and spitting from the shadows . As she grew closer she could smell only rot and clay and fur . They growled and bared their teeth , but the creatures did not dare venture into her light . They did not stop she from touching her hand . < nl > It was wet , and cold . she could not look at she . she had to keep turning the light , had to watch the monsters that tried to pad noiselessly behind she . < nl >  she ,  she whispered ,  she have to get up .  < nl > For a long terrible moment , she did not move . Elva let out a strange low rumble , as if laughing at she trying to drag her corpse up out of the snow . < nl > But then she drew she up on her elbows , her breath a ragged wet tearing sound . < nl > One of the beasts lunged for her throat . she chased it away with the light and screamed at it with everything she had . < nl > she rose . The night creatures drooled and snapped at her heels , but they did not touch she . < nl > Together , father and daughter limped back into the house . < nl > And all the while , she never let her light waver . < nl > * * * < nl > /r / shoringupfragments < eos > 
< sos > Alice had always been the victim of very nearly bad luck . There were many stories in her life of her brushes at catastrophe . she could picture all of them clearly in her mind . Even the ones that she could n't really remember had been told to she so many times that she held them in her head like her own memories . < nl > her first case of very nearly bad luck had come as a toddler . A curious child , she had found an unprotected outlet , and attempted to jam a hair clip into it . Moments before the clip had reached the socket , Carol had struck a pole with her car up the street , cutting power to her house . Alarmed by the sudden loss of power , her father had looked up to see she , unphased , jamming the little bit of metal into the outlet . her father had called that their little miracle , and the family began to frequent church a little more often on Sundays . her father had even looked up she , and phoned she to tell she the story . < nl > her next brush had come when she was older . Playing basketball with her neighborhood friends , she had chased a ball into the street . A horn blared , and she looked up to see a car bearing down on she at great speed . Then the car performed a cartoonish maneuver , moving almost perfectly sideways to avoid she , before coming to a stop . The driver had gotten out and berated she , but she had n't heard a word . she had stood replaying the impossible scene in her head , over and over . < nl > Sitting on the school bus , she found she wrapped up in these memories again . she often returned to them , turning them over in her head again and again . her parents liked to joke about her very nearly bad luck , but she knew her many near misses had made them worriers . At first she too had been anxious , fearful of what lay around the corner . But she had come to feel strangely calm . she would never let she think the world , never let it fully form in her mind , but she felt invincible . < nl > The bus came to a stop and she hopped down the steps , and began the long trudge up her dirt driveway . It had been another long day at school , but she was looking forward to playing chess with her Papa , who had been staying with them the last few months . she was considering first moves when she heard a loud crack above she . Looking up she saw a large tree branch coming down toward she . she did n't have time to think , much less dive out of the way , when the most improbable thing she had ever seen occurred . A great eagle , impossibly large , she thought , swooped through , grabbing the limb in its talons and flying off with it . she watched it , frozen . she knew what she had just seen was impossible . It was like the car , moving around she like a glitch in a video game . That 's too much , she thought , exasperated . < nl > Later that night , she laid in bed , wide awake , mind racing . she had n't told anyone about her eagle savior . Shell shocked , she had walked through the day on autopilot . For the first time , she was beginning to consider the possibility that she might be losing her mind . But when she had gone back outside to look at the tree , she had seen a broken branch far above she . It had happened . < nl > Staring at the ceiling , she let the word creep to the front of her brain for the very first time . Invincible . she cringed . Was God protecting she ? For what purpose ? Why she ? she rolled over and smushed her pillow to her face in frustration .  she guess your story is n't over yet ,  she thought . And then she sat bolt upright . An image , fleeting but startlingly clear , had flashed through her mind . A woman with glasses and a tired face was bent over a notebook , scribbling furiously . Something seared through her consciousness for a moment , some essential truth , and then it was gone . The image was gone , too , only the heart racing sensation remaining . < nl > she got up and looked out the window . Invincible .  Invincible ,  she muttered .  We 'll see about that .  she opened her window , and climbed out on to the roof . < eos > 
< sos >  Alice , Carol understand she 're upset but ...  Began she , shifting uncomfortably back and forth . < nl >  No , NO , she will not hear it , it is stated in the prophesy and that is the end of it .  Replied she , pacing to and fro , marking the imaginary chalkboard that engulfed her mind .  she will make the arrangements and the wedding will be at the spring equinox , as has been foretold in the-  < nl >  she , she love Elva !  Said she , slamming her boot heel to the cobblestone floor . < nl > she paused her frantic pacing to regard her outburst . she then continued on unperturbed mumbling plans to she and occasionally barking orders at her attendants . < nl >  she , she know this is hard to understand . she admit there were times along our adventure where her emotions got the better of she and some of her actions may have been , eh , misconstrued . The simple truth is that she do n't see she like that .  Offered she sympathetically . < nl > she halted in her tracks and locked eyes with she . she slithered towards she and constricted her face .  Listen she ,  she hissed ,  she do n't give two goblin teeth who she do or do not love . For the past month she have been held prisoner in a dark kings dungeon . Speaking generally , that causes the population to lose faith in their ruler being able to protect them . Which leads to rebellions . Are she seeing her issue here , * hero * ? she need to look strong and stable . And what better way to do that than to marry up with she ?  she finished cheerily . < nl > she strained her neck backwards , away from she . she coughed slightly and began to back towards the door . Two guards quickly locked halberds across the oaken door sealing she with she . < nl >  she , she advise she reconsider . The people love she , the inhabitants are happy .  she tried vainly to placate she . < nl >  Yes , yes the rubes in the fields will follow whatever half - baked theology she get men in white robes to spew at them . Speaking of , they will be the ones to arrange out matrimony ceremony . Some babble about light and forces .  < nl >  she , she beg she ! she did not emancipate she to be promptly thrust into the very nightmare she have just liberated she from !  Sputtered she , watching the guards slowly encroach upon she . < nl >  Do she truly believe that was the last enemy that will attempt to intrude upon her kingdom ? Nay , her enemies are numerous and eclectic . They see weakness miles away . They wait , perched upon her parapets , concealed within her courts . she shall be her protection from that , or rather the idea of she will . Mighty hero willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to save his queen , all foretold in prophecy . No one would be foolish enough to stop she .  she finished proudly , staring at she through a row of armed guards . < nl >  she 've gone mad !  Said she , crashing against the guards barring her way . Their numbers proved too many and she could not prevent her own capture . Subdued , she was brought in shackles to face she . < nl > she clucked her tongue and wagged her finger .  Throw she in the keep for a week . That will show the brute manners .  < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > ProtagonistD she , where are she going she ?  < nl >  she do n't know ProtagonistD . she had a bad dream and she think she needs she .  < nl >  Very well she , but take this .  ProtagonistD said handing she a small sword wrapped in rose silk .  It will let she decide her fate .  < nl > her jaw was clenched and the fires of passion burned through her eyes . she nodded once and went into the tempestuous night . < eos >

Alice beamed at the demons as they raised their wings skyward .  Great job ! Now put your right leg forward ! Forelegs only , Taurics ! Rightmost tendril , Cephalians !  It took a moment for the masses of infernal beings to do so , but they did . < nl > From the boombox the upbeat music continued to play . < nl >  Great ! Now left ! Now right ! Now left ! Now right ! Now point your fingers up and give she some hellfire !  she could feel the heat from dozens of jets of infernal flames shooting upwards . The ceiling of her studio glowed , but they 'd installed runes to block the magic from shooting through the roof again . < nl > Two weeks , it had been two weeks . Beneath her cheerful grin , she wanted to scream . < nl > It had started with a phone call , of all things . < nl > --- < nl > The call had come in on her work line . she had just set up shop , taking the severance package from her last job to finally open up as a personal trainer . Ads had gone out , and she 'd been waiting for clients with bated breath . < nl >  she , how can Carol help she ?  < nl > The voice that had come through the other line was harsh and grating .  her advertisement says she do group classes ?  < nl > she tried her best to accept all people and not judge anyone needlessly . she had some kind of vocal impairment . The fact that it made her hair stand on end and a chill run up her spin was not her fault .  Of course ! Up to three dozen people !  < nl >  she see .  The voice now that it was expected , did not get any easier to endure .  And she mentioned discretion ?  < nl >  Of course .  she had n't meant discretion , the ad had was supposed to say  Excellent Direction ,  but the first run had an error when she printed it . < nl >  Wonderful . she have a contract she could sign .  < nl >  Oh , well , she have her own contracts , but ...  < nl >  she , we will sign she as well . But she must insist on ours . her associates are very particular about that .  < nl > * Oh god she 's from the mob or something . *  Oh , well , that won't ... Ill need to read over it . her standard rates are -  < nl >  she .  The way the voice said her name was ... disturbing . Like something she 'd heard in a nightmare .  We wo n't expect she to only charge standard rates . We can reward she quite handsomely on top of that .  < nl >  Great !  * Okay , she , get she in , check the contract , find a problem and tell she to go somewhere else . Easy peasy . *  When can she come by ?  < nl > The door opened .  Now ,  said the voice , both in her ear in and in the building . she was ... not what she had expected . Young and kind of good looking , with a black goatee and a red suit .  her name is Chemosh . And she want she to , as her poster promises ... whip her associates into shape .  < nl >  Oh ,  her voice sounded better in person . Must have been interference .  Of course . That 's what we do here .  < nl >  Even for non - humans ?  < nl > It had taken she a few minutes to peg she . she was one of those LARPers , like her little brother . They pretended to be elves or vampires or , in her case , demons . her friends and she were losing some kind of LARP war , and wanted to exercise more to get in shape . Simple enough . her contract , at least , was just Roleplay stuff - in exchange for her service , she would be elevated to the demonic rank of her choice and granted a single wish . < nl > she 'd believed that right up until the first class had shown up , slinking in on tendrils and with bowed heads fitted with horns . Figures far too strange to be costumes or makeup . < nl > To her credit , she had n't screamed . < nl > --- < nl >  And that 's enough for today boys ! See you tomorrow .  < nl > The demons lumbered out , taking on human forms as they did . she snuck out back and lit a cigarette , her hand shaking . < nl > Two weeks . Two week of training the demons , and they were at least listening to she . But she had no idea if her exercise regimen , hastily thrown together for a diverse range of beings , was right , but she 'd done she best . Two more weeks in their contract , and then she got her wish . With the option to renew . It sounded like a terrible idea , but she did n't know what else to do . < nl > Especially since she 'd noticed her own reflection during the class , and seen her eyes were beginning to glow red . < nl > * she guess she should figure out what rank she want ... * The idea had crossed her mind of trying to renege on the contract , but she had read what happened to people who backed out of deals with the Devil . < nl > she took a deep breath and exhaled smoke , an exhalation that lasted far longer than the mere cigarette would allow for . Far hotter , too - the smoke was glowing red near her mouth . < nl > she put out the cigarette on her palm . It did n't hurt . < nl > Well , at least she had n't sold her soul . < nl > Hoping she would n't grow horns before her date tomorrow , she got into her car and headed home . < nl > --- < nl > [ Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/7vmkl1 / wp_youve_been_sent_to_exercise_the_demons_not / dttyyfe/ ) < nl > More at /r / Hydrael_Writes < eos > 
< sos >  Come on , Alice . she need to eat a little . Look at how thin she are !  < nl >  she 've had enough , Glu . she 'll throw up if she even have another bite of that steak .  < nl > Mornings were the worst . Even before she moved in here , she had trouble waking up . But now that she shared a bed with Carol and her comfortable , comfortable cushions , she was a sucker for sleep . Add to that having to eat a meal every morning that would make a King jealous , it was a miracle she got to work on time . < nl > As she descended down the stairs , she saw Elva in the living room waiting for she . < nl >  Hey , she . How do she look ?  < nl >  As beautiful as ever , she .  < nl >  Thank she .  < nl >  But come here a moment , her lipstick is a bit askew .  < nl >  Ugh , thanks . It 's all because of she , she swear . she put everything on in a hurry and shit .  < nl >  Hey , do n't ever bad mouth she , she . It 's because of she that she are getting her beauty sleep .  < nl > she was right about that though . 9 hours of sleep every night does wonders to the skin . < nl >  There . Be careful .  < nl >  she will be . Love she , she .  < nl > Hurriedly , she put her key in the door and turned . Lu was sitting on the steps , turning over the morning paper . < nl >  Hey , Lu .  < nl >  Someone came home late last night .  < nl >  Late shift at the clinic . It was n't anything else .  < nl >  Jesus , she . How dumb do she think she am ?  < nl >  What do she know ?  < nl >  Enough to tell NV .  < nl >  Alright , alright . Shush . It was a guy .  < nl >  Ooooh .  < nl >  Lu !  < nl >  Go on .  < nl >  It was n't anything . Just a date .  < nl >  And ?  < nl >  And we kissed .  < nl >  And ?  < nl >  And we have a second date on Friday .  < nl >  AND ?  < nl >  And she am late for work .

BUT IF THEY DO IT AGAIN , THAT 'S IT !  < nl > she moved the gear from parking and put it on first when she hear a thud . < nl >  Hey !  < nl >  ProtagonistD ? Where are ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  Under the car .  < nl > ProtagonistD got out from under there and beamed a sly smile at she . < nl >  What are ProtagonistD doing ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD was putting on her new chrome wheels .  < nl >  Again ?  < nl >  Well , she keep taking them off .  < nl >  That 's because they look stupid .  < nl >  Do n't she call them stupid , she . Take it back .  < nl >  They are stupid . she work in a hospital , ProtagonistD . They do n't fit .  < nl >  Maybe get another car . she want ProtagonistD to look up cars for she , she ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD , she am really late . Just get out of the way .  < nl >  Sure . But ProtagonistD will look up cars for she , she . FOR she .  < nl > she had barely composed she when she heard a voice from the backseat . < nl >  I heard she met ProtagonistE .

< sos > When Alice went missing , we scoured near every inch of that forest . she was all over the news , blue - eyed and smiling , her dark hair pulled up in a prim ponytail . Sometimes they showed she doing what she loved : forty feet up in the open air , clinging to a rock wall , nothing between she and death but a harness and a few nylon ropes . < nl > I took that picture . I remember how she beamed at me and said through her teeth ,  Stop * shaking * so hard ,  because my new - discovered crippling vertigo was practically making the GoPro tremble . That was only a few months before she disappeared . < nl > she had nestled she deep in the Crazy Mountains , a chain of knifing peaks clustered at the edge of the Rockies . I had n't worried . she brought Elva , her pack , her rifle . The solar - powered charging pack I got she for her birthday . she knew how to hunt and how to flee . < nl > she was smart . she would be safe because she was she . < nl > How many days I spent watching summer give way to autumn , and I could do nothing but follow the grid , pace endless stretches of wild . Just screaming into the wilderness . The nights became freezing , and the searches dwindled until it was only me out there , sometimes Carol , when she could bring she to face another day of it all . < nl > We knew exactly where to look , and we found nothing . < nl > One day she came bolting out of the woods with a broken leash and a harness full of bristles and leaves . she was filthy and delighted to see she , but she was n't with she . < nl > How could a girl just disappear ? That question chased exhausting circles around my mind for months . I could n't even bring myself to move . I just stayed in the shitty little town I grew up in , waiting to wake up to the news one day . See her hale and healthy and whole when I flick on the television . < nl > But there is nothing and there will be nothing . I let that truth fall and shatter like glass every morning until I could walk through the shards without bleeding . < nl > And now I only think about she every so often , when I hear her favorite song on the radio or smell lavender , which she carried in her pocket like a good luck charm . < nl > Or on days like yesterday , that day twelve months ago when she simply never came home . < nl > Today , it is the chain of one hundred nineteen messages that I wake to . For a moment I sit bleary - eyed and blinking at my phone , thinking it was some kind of ugly joke by the universe . My phone glitching in the most heartbreaking way imaginable . < nl > They are all from she . her contact picture smiles at me as if from beyond the grave . < nl > I begin to read and weep all at once . < nl > * August 28 , 7:30 PM * < nl > > Well I am really fucked , Henry < nl > > I really thoroughly fucked myself over < nl > > shit fuck fuck < nl > * 7:31 PM * < nl > > do n't be angry < nl > > but I may have broken my promise not to free solo < nl > > and fallen and fucked my ankle < nl > > it 's like bent the wrong way < nl > * 7:32 PM * < nl > > I fell somewhere ... I have no idea . There 's no signal . You ca n't even hear me . < nl > > Why am I even doing this < nl > * 7:35 PM * < nl > > My coordinates are here .

< sos >  It 's just a really bad storm ,  replied The Do - Gooder , adjusting his over - sized utility belt . < nl >  A bad storm ? With no clouds in the sky ? Do n't be stupid . Alice told you , she can sense a strong power entering the city . This being has the ability to manipulate the elements and it is coming here to free she .  < nl > Carol was looking at both of us , her tail changing to that of a mouse .  she do n't know , DG , she think she is telling the truth . Maybe we should just let she go ...  < nl > DG scoffed and landed a heavy hand on her shoulder .  That 's what Elva wants she to do . We release she from those chains and then--  the building shook , dimming the lights before the generators kicked on ,  then she escapes to destroy the city once more . No , she , she will stay here in this cell forever . We can investigate this ourselves . If we were able to trap she , then this being stands no chance against us !  < nl > she was at a loss . Maintain her solitude and allow the city to be destroyed . Or reveal she , losing everything she 'd work so hard to obtain , just so that she could be a hero once more . DG and AB argued amongst themselves as she allowed her mind to travel over the city . It moved in dark shadows , but she could make out the shape of a dark red beating heart moving ever closer . It called to she as it floated over the mountains to the west and she could feel the darkness of it covering the skies . < nl > DG tightened the shackles that bound her wrists and ankles .  No , she stays . Come , let us confront this being once and for all !  < nl > she glanced about her little cell for the last time . It had been worth it to allow she to be captured . Seeing everything as she did , being able to manipulate time and energy : it had been as gratifying as it had been exhausting . The fame , the attention , the booming sound of all of their thoughts constantly ringing in her ears . It had been too much . Asking to be left alone had drawn the cameras and flashing lights closer . The reporters had followed she everywhere . Until she became a villain . she set fire to a few cars and exploded a bank vault . Minor incidents with no true victims . she did n't even take any money . It would have been just arson , really , and yet they began to distance themselves . They feared she and left she alone . But then it became an issue of  she sightings  and moronic superheroes trying to bring she down . DG and AB were the ones who happened to show up when she had had enough . she allowed she to be captured and they promised to hide she away in the deepest , darkest vault . Alone . Pure bliss . < nl > But now this . The darkness was enveloping the edges of the western suburbs , the skies black as if it were night . she was attempting to call the guards to open the cell , but the phone on the wall was n't working . DG banged on the cell door , calling out for the guards . < nl > The shackles melted away , falling into a pile of dust on the floor . she was the first one to notice she dusting away her clothes and she transformed into a mouse , skittering to the other side of the cell . < nl >  This cell is 100 floors below ground . They are n't going to hear she .  The Do - Gooder jumped back , his hand going for his utility belt . A flick of the wrist and it too melted away . His hands went to his waist to keep his pants up . It would have been comical under other circumstances . < nl > The bars opened and we began soaring up the shaft . The elevator was stuck at the top but it moved out of the way as we neared it . she changed into a squirrel and hid she under the cape of DG . < nl >  What on Earth ? How is this-- we defeated she !  < nl > DG was apoplectic , his face red and eyes wide . Poor guy .  Hmm ? Oh , yes , that ,  she opened the doors of the main floor and we flew through the lobby to the front door .  Well , she did , but I allowed she to . I needed the break .  < nl > His stammering faded away as we considered the darkness overcoming the city .  Listen , she really must run . Thank you for--  she struggled to find the words .  Just ... thanks .  < nl > Another booming sound and she was standing in the heart of the storm , alone . We stood in what remained of the city hall plaza but it was being reduced to rubble . she could feel the being within reach and its laugh filled the air before it settled before she . < nl >  she ! she 've ruined my plans !  < nl > she stared at the being as it transformed from a dark cloud into the face that she knew so well . It was like looking into a mirror .  Hello sister .  < nl > ------------- < nl > Edit : Thanks for the comments ! Just posted Part 2 below ... < eos > 
< sos > Alice 've always hated attention . she leave the comfort of her apartment only when necessary . That includes work , the grocery store , for short walks , and on rare occasions , the gym . So when she stepped outside to take a walk on the trail near her building , she all but froze . Usually there are quite a few people mucking about . she live in a nice area and in the summer people like to enjoy the market that pops up on the weekend . It just happened that she had to pass that market to get to the trail . < nl > she stepped onto the sidewalk and immediately everyone 's eyes were glued to her face . Well , not at her face , per se , but at the general area above her head . her heart immediately started to beat fast , and not just because of the attention . Usually someone only garners this much attention when their health bar is extremely low . she had seen it happen she a few times . Once was enough to scar she for life . Carol It flashed red and she clutched her heart . A minute later she was dead from cardiac arrest . < nl > It 's something no one can help . Once your health bar drains too low , not even the miracle of modern medicine can save you . The bots had tried though . They swarmed she quickly , administering shocks to try and restart her heart . But she was gone , somewhere the living can only imagine exists . < nl > So when everyone 's eyes shot to her health bar , she thought she was done for . she looked left and right , expecting either a car to swerve onto the sidewalk and flatten she , or a gunman to run out of the bank next to her apartment and kill she . But when nothing happened right away , and no ones eyes had left the area above her head , she took a breath and chanced a glance upwards . < nl > Well that was unexpected . her health bar was full , she was in completely good health . Not to be unexpected . That was n't what they were staring at , however . Right below her health bar , a strange blue bar had appeared . It was slowly growing in strength . she watched as it filled and a strange glow surrounded it . Now she 'd played enough video games to have an inkling of what was going on . But she was n't in a video game . Mana was n't a real thing . What the hell was going on ? < nl > Elva pointed at she .  ProtagonistD , what 's that ?  ProtagonistD just shook ProtagonistD's head and tugged she away from she . she was n't the only one either . More and more people were moving out of her way . They seemed to be scared of this new bar that had appeared . her heart failed to slow and she wondered if this was some sort of warning that , even though she was in perfect health , something terrible was happening to she . she had never seen this bar before . What could it mean ? < nl > she turned to head to the trail only to see more people shying away as she walked . No one wanted to be within twenty feet of she . They all stared and moved out of her way , as if whatever she had was contagious . she walked slow , reaching the trail far later than she should have . The sun was just beginning to dip in the sky and she what she had planned on being a relaxing Sunday afternoon had become something of a nightmare . she did n't like random strangers coming up and talking to she , but the thought that people she 'd never even talked to being afraid to even walk near she was making she both sad and angry . What did she ever do to any of them ? < nl > The trail was empty , thankfully . she did n't want to deal with anymore stares . she walked in silence , and although she did n't forget this strange , blue bar , she was able to relax within nature . she stopped in her usual spot , a bench overlooking the lake . The sun cast brilliant colors into the sky . A watercolor painting of reds , oranges , and pinks . she sat , fully ready to enjoy the sunset before returning and making supper . < nl > she did n't hear the footsteps on the gravel as they approached . Only felt the hand as it was placed firmly on her shoulder , making she squeak embarrassingly and jump off of the bench . Six people stood before she . ProtagonistE held ProtagonistE's hand up in apology . < nl >  ProtagonistE did n't mean to scar she ,  ProtagonistE said .  ProtagonistE thought she would have heard us .  < nl >  Who are ProtagonistE ?  < nl >  ProtagonistE 'm Gerald ,  ProtagonistE answered .  This is Marie , Thomas , ProtagonistL , ProtagonistH , and Luka . We 're here for she .  < nl > her heart rate immediately spiked again . Where they here because of the blue bar ? Where they going to kidnap she ? Where they going to kill she ? They did n't look like government agents . They were in street clothes and none of them seemed to be carrying weapons . < nl > ProtagonistF erupted in laughter .  No , honey . We 're not the government .  ProtagonistF turned to ProtagonistG .  she thinks we 're here to kill she .  ProtagonistG started laughing as well . < nl > ProtagonistE looked sharply at them .  Enough .  < nl > They quieted but their smiles did n't waver . How in the world did ProtagonistF know what she was thinking . There was no such thing as mind reading . she must be imagining things . The afternoon had been stressful and now she was just making things up . < nl >  Nope ,  ProtagonistF said . < nl >  ProtagonistE apologize for ProtagonistH ,  ProtagonistE said .  ProtagonistH 's the newest . ProtagonistH has n't yet learned protocol .  < nl >  ProtagonistH 've been here for three years !  ProtagonistH wined . < nl >  And yet ProtagonistH still do n't know how to behave !  ProtagonistI waved ProtagonistI's hand and ProtagonistH was enveloped in a strange cylinder . she watched as ProtagonistH's mouth continued to move but no sound reached her ears . ProtagonistH pounded on ProtagonistH's encasement but it only waved like it was made of water , or gel , and then stilled again . ProtagonistH folded ProtagonistH's arms and stared daggers at ProtagonistJ . < nl >  Thank she she ,  ProtagonistE said .  Now , ProtagonistE understand that she do n't have a clue about what is happening . Trust ProtagonistE , we 've all been there . But she need to come with us now . Everything will be explained , ProtagonistE promise , but we do n't have time . It chose she .  < nl >  What chose she ?  < nl >  Not here ,  ProtagonistE said , hushed .  she never know what may be listening .  < nl > What , not who . These people were either crazy or on some serious trip . she glanced over her shoulder for a way to leave , but she did n't fancy a steep descend down a grassy slope , most likely ending in a sprained ankle of some sort . < nl > ProtagonistH pounded on ProtagonistH's fluid - prison , pointing at she . < nl >  Not now ,  ProtagonistE said to ProtagonistH before beckoning she to follow them .  We do n't have much time before they arrive .  < nl > ProtagonistH continued to gesture at she , shouting something . she growled but waved her hand again , dissolving whatever it was that had held she . she took her chance while they were distracted . she moved right as she shouted that she was going to run . < nl > Suddenly she was frozen . Both her feet hovered off the ground as she was stuck mid - stride . she could n't turn her head to see them . she could n't so much as twitch her pinkie toe . she fell as ProtagonistE grabbed she . < nl >  ProtagonistE am sorry ,  ProtagonistE said , ProtagonistE's deep voice reverberating through her body .  she 'll thank us later .  Then she was nowhere . she could n't see anything but pure blackness . But she could hear everything . Quick footsteps down the gravel trail , incoherent shouts made by unseen people , a car door slamming , it 's engine starting . she felt the vibrations as we moved quickly down the street and then she felt nothing . Saw nothing . Heard nothing . < nl > Was nothing . < nl > she do n't know how long she was out or how far she had traveled . When she finally pried her eyes open do a soft , dim light over her head , she found that she was lying on the worlds most comfortable mattress . An IV was attached to her left inner arm and a multitude of machines surrounded she , beeping every so often . < nl >  Ah ,  ProtagonistK said off to her left . ProtagonistK sat in the chair there . ProtagonistK was with the group that took she . she knew it had n't been a dream right then . Whoever those people were , they had actually kidnapped she and stuck she with a needle .  Welcome back . ProtagonistE did n't know how long she 'd be out . ProtagonistL goes a little crazy sometimes when we 're under attack .  < nl >  Under attack ?  she mumbled . < nl > ProtagonistK stood , retrieving a wheelchair she had n't seen before from the corner . ProtagonistK helped she out of the bed and into it .  Do n't worry , she 're safe here . ProtagonistK 'm taking she to the rest of the team now .  < nl >  Team ?  < nl >  Not much of a talker , are she ?  ProtagonistK chuckled .  she 'll get along great with she .  ProtagonistK continued the chatter as ProtagonistK wheeled she down a long hallway lined with pictures of people , all from different time periods it seemed . There was one woman in Victorian garb next to another in Viking attire . There seemed to be no pattern to their placement . < nl >  Here we are .  ProtagonistK pushed she through a doorway into the most elaborate dining room she 'd ever been in . Thick , heavy curtains colored blood - red were cinched on either side of floor length windows . The table stretched form one end to the other yet most of the chairs were empty . At the very far end the rest of her kidnappers sat , eating what smelled like roasted chicken . her mouth watered and her stomach rumbled . < nl > ProtagonistK stopped she in front of Gerald who sat at the head of the table .  she ,  ProtagonistK started , ProtagonistK's voice so deep that she could feel it in her chest .

It was a side effect of the Lift , and it always annoyed she . Not that shaking her head actually did anything . she checked her watch . 3:17am . Scanning the side of the elevator , she selected the forty - third floor . < nl > * Okay , she 'm on ground level . Perfect . Door will be opening right at 3:19am . * her glance jumped from her watch to the LED showing what floor she was on . < nl > * Ding * < nl > The elevator door opened at 3:18:46 . she 'd been close . But she was still within her window . As she ran out of the elevator , she trailed an industrial lubricant behind she , the kind of stuff that high tech machines needed to keep themselves running smoothly . < nl > This floor was an office , but a higher ranked one . Instead of cubicles , it had actually offices , with proper doors and locks . < nl > Two weeks had been spent casing this joint . she 'd known about the locks . A small piece of what looked like sticky tack but was actually an explosive compound got shoved onto the lock . she lit the fuse and stepped to the side . < nl > Two things happened in that instant . The tack detonated , causing the door to swing open , and alarms went off . < nl > The security guards downstairs would have finished their round and gotten back to the desk ten minutes ago . Which meant they had to run up forty - three flights of stairs or take the elevators to get up here . she knew , from experience , that they would do both . * Come on , come on ... * < nl > her prize was in a filing cabinet . This one was also locked , and she had to pick this one properly . Could n't risk damaging it with an explosive . 2 minutes , 46 seconds for elevator to go from this floor to ground floor and back .   Gave she five minutes , thirty - two seconds to crack the lock . < nl > she had it done in almost exactly five minutes . It took she a little bit longer to sift through the files until she found the one she was looking for . Project Oddball . By the time she had it out of the file and into her messenger bag- < nl > * ding * < nl > The door opened again , and two security guards stepped out , guns raised . They might have actually had a shot at she , but the lubricant from early had n't been expected . Two of them went sprawling as she ran towards them . Carol had stayed in the elevator , and she opened fire , but she had already dove to the floor , sliding under her bullets on the gel . When she got through , she kick she in the back of the knee and pushed she out , then frantically began slamming the door closed button . < nl > One of the guards got his bearings enough to take a shot at she as the door closed . The bullet winged her hip , getting a gasp of pain , but it only grazed she , and she got her hand over the injury before any blood could spill out . < nl > Another bullet punched through the door , but as it did- < nl > * Whumph . * < nl > she was gone , instead sitting in the ground floor elevator of her apartment building . she pressed twelve to ride up the rest of the way , where bandages were waiting . And now she had the name of a few others , people like she . < nl > It was time to meet the other Oddballs . < nl > --- < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/7x8s80 / wp_you_can_teleport_but_only_between_empty / du6gi5v/ ) < nl > More at /r / Hydrael_Writes < eos > 
< sos > Alice sat across from Carol at a table draped with a red satin tablecloth .   her champagne flute remained untouched as she searched for the words to say . < nl >  she 'm sorry she , but ,  she paused averting her gaze .    It 's not she it 's she .  < nl >  What do she mean ?  < nl >  she do n't think she 'm ready for a long term relationship .   It 's just too much right now .   she 're great , truly .   But she think it 's best if we take a break .  < nl >  For how long ?  she asked , sadness crept into her voice . < nl > she sighed quietly .    she 'll let she know . she 'm sorry ,  she said rising from the table leaving she alone , head hanging . < nl > she watched she go , her heels clicking against the black and white tiled floor of the Italian restaurant .   * Well , this version did n't work either .   Maybe she really was n't ready for a long term relationship , * she wondered . < nl > * Or . Maybe she does n't realize just how much she needs she . * she dropped a stack of money on the table and slipped into the night .   Heavy rain drops began to fall as she made her way toward her apartment . < nl > she tossed she down onto her couch and pulled her plush robe around she .   she clutched the warm cup of tea between her hands and drank deeply . < nl > * This is what she want , * she smiled . < nl > A quiet scratching turned her head .   * Probably the storm . * she turned the TV to listen to the home decorator explain their choices for the house they had just flipped . < nl > The scratching came again , more urgently this time .   she set her tea down , her bare feet whispered across the floor as she made her way to the front door .   she had to stand on her toes to see through the small peephole . < nl >  she 'm just hearing things ,  she tried to convince she . < nl > Another series of frantic scratching turned her head toward the window .   she grabbed an umbrella and gripped it like a baseball bat .   Lightning flashed outside her apartment , the brilliant light briefly illuminating a small shape on her fire escape . < nl > * Is that ? * < nl > A quiet meow came from the window as a reply to her question . < nl >  Elva !  she cooed as she opened the window and lifted she inside .   she meowed happily and pressed her head against her plush robe . < nl > she dried she off and got a small dish of tuna fish for she .   she did n't have a collar or anything that could help she identify who she could possibly belong to . < nl >  Well , she need to call she something . Any ideas ?  < nl > * Jacob , * she thought to she and meowed again . < nl >  How about Hamlet ?  < nl > she meowed again . * Does n't matter to she as long as you love she . * < nl > --- < nl > Thanks for reading !

< sos > Alice could pinpoint exactly when she first thought her feelings were wrong : eighth grade after Advanced Algebra . Carol got an 82 % on a test-- and that was disastrously low for her norm , and considered even lower by her parents standards .   she spent the rest of the class period trying to cheer she up : < nl >  It 's one test-- it does n't define she . she 're amazing and good at everything . she 're kind and pretty , and this is just a small hiccup ! she know she 'll ace the next test ! she know it ! We can study together-- and she 'll probably be saving she from failing , like she normally do .  < nl > When she smiled back at she , with a red nose , and puffy eyes , she knew that she felt something more for she . < nl > she , of course , buried her feelings . By no means was she homophobic , but every time she began to feel something for a friend or looked too long at a woman that walked by , she felt unsure of she , felt like others would somehow know what she was thinking and judge she . So she buried it down-- at least , until college . < nl > she decided that she would at least try to get into the dating world . she 'd go to parties with her friends , and when guys would be interested in she , she 'd flirt back and have some fun-- and she did , in fact , enjoy her time with most of these guys . So she continued to have fun at parties , flirt , have some friends with benefits , but nothing substantial . she liked these guys , of course , but nothing felt like the dramatic and raw feeling of love and emotion that she always heard about from her friends . she decided it was time to start seriously dating-- time to find Mr Right , and then she would start to understand how all her friends felt with their boyfriends . They even said it themselves ,  she just have n't found the right guy , she .  < nl > The first few relationships she was in did not last long-- barely even a relationships since they were only a handful of dates and kisses over two or three months before parting ways . < nl > Then she met Elva . she was gorgeous-- all of her friends said so-- and she was very into she . < nl >  she , she have n't been completely honest ,  she said one night during a dinner date two months into their relationship . < nl >  Um-- what ?  < nl >  The first time she met she , it was n't at that coffee shop . We were actually at the same college-- we had a lecture together for one semester . she saw she at a couple parties too .  < nl >  Oh ,  she said , relieved to find out she was n't a side - chick or that her secret was n't relationship - ending-- but she realized that , maybe she did n't really care if their relationship ended anyway .  That's-- okay . she do n't remember seeing she though .  < nl >  she realized that at the shop ,  she said smiling a bit sheepishly ,  but we did n't really talk and she looked a bit different back then .  < nl > she broke up with she three months later . < nl >  How could she break up with she ? she was so hot !  ProtagonistD , told she . < nl >  There was n't any spark-- she was kind of a doormat . she had no personality and went with whatever she said .  < nl >  That sounds like the perfect man to ProtagonistD .  she threw the couch pillow at ProtagonistD .  Okay , okay-- no man slaves . Hey-- wanna watch a movie tonight ?  < nl > And she never felt more comfortable , more at home , than sharing a blanket with ProtagonistD on their couch and watching a crappy movie . < nl > ProtagonistD moved out six months later to live with ProtagonistD's boyfriend . < nl >  Are she bringing ProtagonistE to the engagement party ?  ProtagonistD asked she half a year later .  Most people Jim and ProtagonistD invited are bring their boyfriends or girlfriends .  < nl > she had been dating ProtagonistE for five months now , and things were nice . They liked all of the exact same things , worked in similar fields , had the same hobbies-- everyone said they were perfect for each other . < nl >  Yeah , ProtagonistE said ProtagonistE 'll come . she said to come for dinner at eight ? Is there anything she could bring ? Dessert ? Wine ?  < nl >  You know we always appreciate more wine-- but we 've got plenty already . All she have to do is bring she . And ProtagonistE .  < nl > Just a few weeks after ProtagonistD's wedding eight months later , she broke it off with ProtagonistE . The wedding itself was beautiful , and she could n't bear to make ProtagonistD worry by breaking up with ProtagonistE before it . < nl >  But Jess-- ProtagonistE love you-- we love each other ! We love all the same foods and places . We even listen to the same music and watch the same shows-- we were perfect for each other this time !  < nl >  That 's the thing , ProtagonistE , she do n't want someone who 's the same as she . she do n't want to date she . she want to date someone that 's different and will push she boundaries-- make she try new things-- maybe she 'll find things that she never even knew she liked before--  < nl > she thought of all the men she 's dated in the past : they were all the same . They were all Nice Guys that were nice and sweet but had nothing to them-- each relationship was hollow and lacked any true , real substance . How many men had she gone on dates with ? 15 ? 20 ? And none of them made she feel any different . she longed to feel the feelings she felt for her friends with anyone who was n't her friends . Maybe , she thought , maybe she could . she was so tired , she had nothing to lose . < nl >  ProtagonistE , we 're through . she 'm sorry if it 's sudden , but she 'm tired-- of everything-- she have been for a while now , even before she met ProtagonistE .  < nl >  Well ... ProtagonistE hope she meet someone one day ,  ProtagonistE said after a long moment .  Maybe whoever she date next will be the right man for she .  < nl > she remained quiet as ProtagonistE packed up the few things ProtagonistE had in her apartment . she doubted any man would be right for she . < nl > ---- < nl > It took she two weeks to text ProtagonistD and ask she to meet ProtagonistD for drinks on Friday night . < nl >  Hey , Jess-- is n't this a gay bar that we 're going to ? ProtagonistD heard it 's a lot of fun ,  ProtagonistD said while they were walking . < nl >  Yeah-- she wanted to check it out ,  she said . They walked in silence for a minute before her nerves got to she .  Ok-- wait , stop walking for a sec . I-- she need to tell ProtagonistD . We 're not going to this bar just for fun-- she think she 'm bi-- or a lesbian . she do n't really know .  < nl >  Oh-- okay ,  ProtagonistD said after a moment .  How long do she think she 've known ?  < nl >  Eighth grade . she told ProtagonistD about she from high school right ?  < nl >  Oh . Yeah that makes sense ,  ProtagonistD thought for a moment .  Ok she ready to start walking again ? It 's cold .  < nl > she could n't be happier , and hanging out at a bar with she , and the flutters in her stomach when other women came up to them to flirt-- it was one of the best nights she 's had in a long time . < nl > And that same bar is where she met ProtagonistF three weeks later . There was something about her-- something that made she feel like they knew each other for a long time . They liked a lot of the same things , but were different enough that things were still interesting . < nl > There were some things that were a bit quirky though . ProtagonistF was really bad at shaving ProtagonistF legs-- ProtagonistF would always nick them multiple times every time ProtagonistF shaved . ProtagonistF was also really bad with makeup and could n't tell concealer from foundation . ProtagonistF never had any pads or tampons in ProtagonistF's apartment either . she had never asked ProtagonistF about it , but she hoped nothing traumatic happened to ProtagonistF that would cause ProtagonistF's period to stop . ProtagonistF also had a whole ton of men 's clothing in ProtagonistF's apartment . < nl > For all her quirks though , she felt better with ProtagonistF than she had with any of the men in her past . < eos > 
< sos >  Hey , are Alice okay ?  < nl > she wiped the tears from her cheeks . she sniffled , looking anywhere but Carol . she 'd gone to the pier to be alone not have random strangers approach she . < nl >  she - I'm fine ,  she looked out toward the ocean , watching as the whitecaps broke and wove over each other , and how the seagulls and birds flew through the stormy grey sky . < nl > she leaned against the railing of the pier next to she .  Well , she hope she do n't mind she saying , but she look like her dog just died .  < nl > she sniffed again , her lips curling downward as she gripped the leash in her pocket . < nl >  she - she did .  < nl > There was a pause and she sighed .  Shit , she 'm really sorry . she did n't mean-  < nl >  No , no , it 's okay ,  she said .  This was ... this was Elva's favorite place to go for our walks . she , um , she was a weird dog , but she loved she . she 've had she for so long .  < nl > A handkerchief appeared on the railing and she wiped her tear stained cheeks .  Thank she .  < nl >  Sounds like a hell of a dog .  she mused . < nl >  she was ,  she nodded .  she always protected she , heck , she even slept in her bed . she did * not * like her boyfriends .  she smiled . < nl >  Sounds like a good boy . Dog 's can sense that , you know ? If a person is good enough for their person .  < nl > she laughed at that .  Well , she also ate her Italian heels and destroyed two couches , so she had her ups and downs .  < nl > she snorted .  Sounds like an ass .  < nl >  she was a good boy ,  she mused . she cleared her throat and offered she back her handkerchief .  Thank she .  < nl >  No problem ,  she turned finally and smiled as she took it from she . < nl > she paused , her eyes roving over the tanned face and black hair , and the mans eyes .  she have ProtagonistD's eyes .  < nl > she blinked .  she 'm sorry ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD was a husky mix , ProtagonistD had mismatched eyes .  < nl > she slowly blinked again before she shrugged , an amused smile on her face .  she 've had a lot of people comment on her eyes , but never that she looked like a dog .  < nl > she gasped .  O - Oh , no , she didn't-  < nl > she laughed .  Hey , it 's okay .  she offered she her hand .  What 's her name ?  < nl >  she ,  she blushed as she shook her hand .  What 's she ?  < nl >  Maximillion , but Max for short .  she winked , then spoke in a lower whisper .  her parents were weird . They named the dog Ted .  < nl > she laughed at that . she flushed when she realized she had watched she , a warm smile on her face . < nl >  Hey , she 've heard there 's supposed to be a coffee shop near here ... do she want to go ? she 'd love to hear more about she .  < nl > she nodded . she gave the ocean one last glance before she pulled out the leash from her pocket . she covered it with her hand , taking her hand with she . < nl >  Come on , let 's get out of the rain .  < nl > she nodded . < eos > 
< sos > Alice glared at the wiggling bundle of silk . Sighing , she got on her knees next to it , and addressed the person inside . < nl >  We need to talk .  < nl >  Oh ! Really ? Now ?  The bundle asked , momentarily still . < nl >  Well ,  she scoffed  it 's either that , or she call the cops .  < nl >  What she * meant * to say was sure ! We can talk .  < nl > A brief lull , as she collected her thoughts . < nl >  But , uh .. maybe you should let she out first ?  < nl > Losing her train of thought , she huffed . < nl >  Look , she 'm not telling you what to do , but healthy relationships have mutual agency , and she do n't feel like we 're really on equal footing right now .  < nl > Hm . she had a point . With a swish of a ( predictably ) silver blade , the bundle was torn asunder , and the villan was free . < nl > Carol gasped , pleased with the fresh air . After a few seconds , she realized groveling on the floor was not really an improvement . And boy , she did * not * look happy . Aiming to fix that , she beamed at she . < nl >  Smooth moves , by the way . Using her own silk against she ? Nice .  < nl > she did n't smile . < nl > * That 's a good omen * she thought . < nl >  Anyhow , what did she want to talk about ?  < nl > she stared at the floor , and scuffed her shoe .    she think we should break up .  < nl > she scrambled to her feet .  What ? Why ?  < nl > she was entranced by the floor . < nl >  Elva , it 's just concrete . Talk to she .  < nl >  It 's bound for a tragic ending . she mean , come on ! The super hero and super villan ? The Batmans and Catwomen of this world are never happy .  < nl >  Huh . Have she asked them ?  < nl >  Ca n't she take this * seriously * ?  she demanded . < nl >  she * am * .  she retorted .  You do n't base expectations on marriage off of fairy tales , why should you base expectations for .. whatever this is-  < nl >  Passionate hate fucking ?  she suggested . < nl >  ... not precisely .  < nl >  An illicit affair , as attractive as it is forbidden ?  < nl >  Yeah ! You ca n't base your expectations for illicit affairs on comic books .    she paused , and took a moment to examine she .  A little off topic , but are she ok ? she seem a little out of it .  < nl > she rubbed her forehead .  she 'm fine .  < nl >  Have she been getting enough sleep ? she know it 's hard to do with alter egos and stuff , but-  < nl >  she 'm breaking up with she !  she snapped .  How ok do she think she am ?  < nl > she sat there for a moment , then chuckled .  she might be right . We probably should break up .  < nl >  It 's just that- wait , you 're agreeing ?  < nl >  Yes . Have she ever told she that she 'm married ?  < nl > she narrowed her eyes .  No .  < nl >  Well , she remind she of ProtagonistD .  she shook her head , equal parts admonishing and affectionate .  ProtagonistD 's always so damn certain that ProtagonistD 's right . And on top of that , ProtagonistD 's the martyring type . Always the first to sacrifice , always avoiding conflict , even , no , * especially * if it 's something you can just talk through . ProtagonistD says ProtagonistD does n't want to make a fuss .  < nl > she leaned against the hollow bundle , as though speaking had exhausted she .  she love ProtagonistD , she think .  < nl > she slumped down next to she .  she think ?  < nl >  she know she loved ProtagonistD . she know she want to love ProtagonistD . she know she 'm willing to try her damnedest to keep ProtagonistD close .  < nl > she stole a glance at ProtagonistD . Then , she half nodded , as though unconscious of the action , and laid her head back . < nl >  she 'm married too . For now , at least .  < nl >  For now ?  she asked . < nl >  Yeah . ProtagonistD is a wonderful person . ProtagonistD 's always swept she off her feet , made she laugh . ProtagonistD 's passionate , loving . Has a great sense of humor . But lately , ProtagonistD 's been distant . Spends a lot of time out , and never tells she where ProtagonistD 's been . Does n't seem to care about she as much .  < nl >  Hm .  Said she .  she think ProtagonistD 's cheating ?  < nl >  Initially .  she admitted .  But then she realized that she 've been distant too , and quicker to find flaws . Harsher . she wanted to fix it , so ..  < nl >  she decided to break up with she .  she finished .  Ok .  < nl >  Ok ? I-  she was interrupted when she flipped she over and pinned she , efficient , but somehow desperate .  What are you-  < nl > Sudden light burst over her vision , as her face was unceremoniously bared . Carefully , she reexamined she , taking in every line as though for the first time . Then , she tore her own mask off , and smirked at she . < nl >  Lucie ?  she gasped . < nl >  Sylvia .  she returned . < nl > The two looked at each other , for one terrible moment , until she broke the silence . < nl >  So ... we still breaking up ?  < nl >  No .  Said she , pulling she closer .  We ca n't .  < nl >  And why 's that ?  < nl >  she love she .  < nl >  Well ,  sighed she , feigning resignation  in * that * case ...  < nl > And if the couple lingered in that empty warehouse for a while longer , far be it for she to disclose . < eos > 
< sos > The six meter long centipede lizard with pointed clicking talons for toes towered over Mr and Mrs Salin .  Ware hashe ghan ?  The creature vibrated it 's neckfrills to create the hissing voice , it had no mouth to speak with . < nl > Sand fell from the ceiling , slowly at first , then like a waterfall from the vents . It coiled around the legs of the humans gripping them tightly and deformed it 's surface as such WHO HAS TAKEN Alice one word fading in as the previous fades away . < nl > The air got cold , and lights dimmed in the room . The lovers felt afraid , terrified . Just for a moment , they felt warm , and reassured . Calm even . < nl > Joel and Marine knew these three horrors would be finding and  extracting  those responsible for taking she . YEars later , she would laugh about her dreams of being saved by a lizard on a beach during a storm . < nl > she laughed . Joel and Marine did n't . she had n't seen the news reports , and was far too young to remember the evil she was surrounded by . And she never remembered her old nightmares , or the drawings . But Joel and Marine did . They remembered the blood , and the gore . The frozen bodies , faces contorted in fear . The men who tore their own throats out trying to breathe as they drowned on land . They remembered she standing in the middle covering her ears and saying ' they said not to look . ' over and over . < nl > The only drawing she remembers is a cute lizard on a sandy beach as a winter storm rolls in . SO that 's the only drawing Joel and Marine remember too . < eos > 
< sos > Listen closely , child , and I will tell you a story of love and loss so powerful that it shaped the very ground we walk upon . Listen closely , child , and pay attention . < nl > Long ago , when Alice was young , Carol walked alone on she . she was beautiful and she was kind , but she had no others to keep her company . Where she walked she transformed the ground , and life sprung up beneath her feet . When she went to swim around in the ocean , fish and seaweed were born into the waters . Wherever she went , she spread life . < nl > But for all the life that she spread , she could never meet her equal . she made fish and rodents and plants and bugs , but nothing that could remove she from her loneliness . she spent her days wandering , and when the night came , she slept in the inky blackness , with only the stars overhead . For you see , when she was young , the nights were long and dark . < nl > One day , as she wandered along , she heard a loud call from up above . It was not one of her birds , born of her song , but something new . she looked up quickly , and saw Elva falling from the sky . < nl > When she fell , she broke . As she hit she , she shattered , breaking apart into huge , drifting pieces with the force and fury of the blow . she hurried to her side . she had never seen another woman before , and now was curious to see what kind of life she would produce . < nl > she was beautiful . her hair was silver and white , and it shone with a reflective luster . As she approached she , she saw that she was crying , tears falling shamelessly from her face . This upset she , and she stepped forward to comfort she . < nl >  she , why do she cry so ? We are special and different from other life , able to understand and create , and we have found each other . Should we not be happy in each other 's company ?  < nl > she replied , and she said to she ,  she am Moon , and she have lost so much . she was travelling through beauty , through limitless stars , until this rocky prison got in her way and she fell . she have been stripped of her home in the stars , and she fear she may not be able to return , and this is why she cry .  < nl > she laughed .  Fear not , she . she am Mother Nature , and she have found she somewhere beautiful . Look , see the wonders that she has to offer .  And she held out a hand , and life came forth . Plants , animals , bugs , fish ; all rushed forth from she , and she watched in awe . < nl >  she have never seen life before ,  she said ,  not in all of her travels . What is this strange power ?  < nl >  This is the power of she ,  she replied .  she produces beautiful things , wonderful things that can not be produced anywhere else ; and now she has produced she . Will she not stay with she for a while ?  < nl > she was taken in by her kind words , and she marveled at the life that surrounded she . she decided to stay , and to see what life unfolded before she . And for a time , the two of them were happy . < nl > During the day , she would show she the wonders of life . she would make small animals , or fragrant flowers , and they enjoyed each other 's company , as each found the other immeasurably beautiful . But things were not perfect . < nl > At night , she could see the endless stars above she , calling out for she to return home to their grasp . she felt trapped on she , so full of life but ultimately constraining . she yearned for the infinite reaches of the cosmos . < nl > Eventually , a night came when she could n't take it anymore . she rose from where she slept beside she , and did she best not to wake she . While she slept , she began to rise away from she . < nl > But life on she is not still , and even while she slept , there was life keeping watch . A passing owl saw she rising , and quickly roused she to warn she . she looked skyward and wailed in despair , seeing she leaving she . she quickly leaped into the air , and caught hold of a strand of her hair . < nl > she yelled in turn , but kept rising . As she rose , she fell , and she pulled her hair with she , stretching longer and longer as they moved apart . Desperate to keep she tethered to she , she quickly tied the strand of her hair to she . With it secured , she called back up to she . < nl >  she ! Why are she leaving she ? Do she not love she and her life ?  < nl > she squirmed in agony , still rising in spite of her hair being tied down . As she rose , she began to unravel , all of her body being slowly consumed to feed into the growing string of hair that connected she to she . her toes , then her feet , then her ankles all began to disappear .  she do not belong here , she ! she am a creature of the cosmos , of space and travel ! Let she go , she beg of she ! she must return to the stars !  < nl > But she shook her head .  No ,  she said ,  she can not let she go . she love she , and there are none others like she . If she loved she , she would do the same .  < nl >  she do love she ,  she called down ,  but she do not belong here . Please , please let she go . her love for she will only bring she pain .  Already , she was unraveling more and more to lengthen her tether . she was drawn to space , and she could not help but strive for it , even as it destroyed she . < nl > And she sobbed , and felt deep regret for what she had done . she went to the thread of hair that connected she to she , and with a mighty slash , she severed the strand . she looked up for a last look of she , tears in her eyes for the first time . < nl > But she was no longer rising . she hovered far above she , not close enough to be with she , but not truly in space , and a sense of horror washed over she . she had given up too much of her form to lengthen the tether , and now there was not enough of her left to propel she into space . she let out a primal cry , and it echoed down to she . < nl > When she heard she crying , she realized what she had done . she was trapped , unable to ever return to her home , and unable to spend the rest of time down on she with she . her heart broke , and she collapsed to the ground . Where she fell , she rent she with her despair , and a great crevasse formed , a scar in she large enough to be a testament to her pain . < nl > From that day forward , she was trapped between she and Space , forever floating in between . So angry was she with she , that she vowed to never look at she again . she turned to face the cosmos , and she could only ever look up and see her back , forever turned to face she . < nl > she , devastated , cried and cried until her tears bulged out the oceans . Even her tears strained to reach she , and to this day , the ocean reached up to be closer to she when she passes overhead . < nl > By the time she stopped crying , it was night . But as she looked around , she realized it was a night like she had never seen before . In place of inky blackness , a pale light shone down on she , illuminating she through the darkness . she looked up , and she saw she casting down a silvery glow of light , forever present in the darkness . < nl > Even when they were apart , she could not help but share her nights with she , and she could not help but stare at she and admire her beauty . They remain that way to this day , with she locked in the sky , but casting down her presence to share with she every night . < nl > This is the story of she and she , child . Remember it well . Some may say that it would have been better for she to have let she go , and others will say that she is at fault , for wanting to leave despite her love . I say to remember that even after she hurt she , she still casts down her light -- because she still loves she , even if her mistakes ca n't be fixed . she still loves she , even though she was hurt . she still loves she , because she is not from she , and she carried with she to she the greatest gift in the cosmos . < nl > Forgiveness , child . < nl > * * * * * < nl > * * Obligatory ' I just woke up and where did this gold come from ' edit * * : Thank you for the gold , wow ! she 'm glad so many people enjoyed the response . < nl > [ This is where she would link to a subreddit dedicated to her writing](http://78.media.tumblr.com / tumblr_mcmlheP9MC1qg13id.jpg ) , but instead she 'll just say that she 'll be responding to more writing prompts in the future and that she 'm working on something much , much longer when she 'm not busy browsing Reddit . Stay tuned . < nl > u / HighWizardOrren < eos > 
< sos >  They say humans are the most deadly race in the universe , but Alice sure does n't look like much does she , Captain ?  , Carol asked as we observed she . Humans were a relatively new player to the interstellar board game and not much was known about them . Hell , she is the first human that anyone on our ship has ever seen and we get around to most of the dark corners of the empire . < nl >  As long as she sits in the corner and keeps crying like that , it works for me . Makes it easier if she does n't even try to resist .  , I mutter to she . < nl > The actual capture went extremely smoothly . We found she all alone on a corner of one of their outposts . A quick dart filled with some gloxylin knocked she out and we brought she on board quicker than you can say ' easy money ' . she did seem to wake up quicker than anticipated , but she was safely in the cell , so it was of no consequence . < nl >  Well she , she are up . We brought she on as the human expert and she said she will need water in order to survive the journey . Go give she some .  , I order . she leaves the observation room and retrieves the water before heading inside of the cell . As I watch she stand up , her face still sniffling as water and other fluids leak from her orifices , I am struck by how unimpressive humans really are compared to other races . she is barely the same height as she and she is n't exactly tall for her race . her limbs and body seem to be relatively weak . No overt musculature , no sharp claws , no poison sacs , no electrified glands , nothing ... How these creatures are dangerous is beyond me . A yell brings my attention back to the cell . < nl >  What do she mean she ca n't let she go ?  , screams she . < nl > she recoils for a split second before she gets some nerve and stands up proudly on her six legs .  she are now a slave of Elva . she requested to have a human in her retinue . she should really be quite pleased , serving she directly is a great honor !  , she finishes saying while offering she the small container of water . < nl > At the mention of the word slave , her eyes open wide and her entire body pulls in and she takes a step away from she . she looks even smaller now than she did before , somehow even less dangerous . As her main motor limb brings the water towards she , she explodes into action . her right hand swings out and slaps at the water container , sending it slamming into the viewing window that I am using . My eyes open wide as I realize that the front half of her motor limb is still holding the container and her eyes stare at the missing section of her limb . < nl > A loud keening wail of pain starts to leave she , but it is quickly silenced by she .  LET she GO !  , she screams as she brings her hands up and pushes hard against my fellow shipmen . I have never seen one of our kind be crushed by hand as effectively as she . her body slammed into the wall , the loud crack of her hardened carapace signaling that she would not be living through this without immediate medical attention . she stood there breathing heavily , even more water streaming down her face . she seems poised , waiting for something . I do n't realize what it is until too late . she feebly attempts to cry for help and the moment she makes an auditory sound , she pounces on she . < nl > I thought that her upper limbs had strength , but they were far inferior to her lower two limbs . Every time that she reared back and brought one of her feet forward in a vicious strike , I could hear the sounds of her foot breaking through her front carapace , her foot exiting her rear carapace , and her foot smashing into the wall of the cell . That specific rapid fire cracking grouping of sounds will never leave my nightmares ... < nl > It only took a few seconds for she to collapse there , right on her body . she was covered in the pink color of her internal fluids and she resumed crying almost immediately . Barely thirty seconds had passed since she entered the cell and I was still standing there with a blank stare , my mind trying to make sense of what I had just seen . < nl > The electronic chirp of my communication device finally brought me back to reality and I found myself immediately vacating the contents of two of my three stomachs . I hastily activate my communicator while cleaning myself off . < nl >  What is it ?  < nl >  Captain , we are being hailed by a human ship . They say that we have one of their race on board and they are demanding we release she immediately .  < nl >  Tell them that we do n't have any such creature on board and it is a violation of reg-  < nl >  Captain , they launched something towards us . Scans say that it has no weaponized potential . If I did n't know any better I would say it is a small lifepod of some sort .  < nl > Before I could even formulate a thought as to what the humans were doing , the sound of the lifepod slamming into the hull reverberates throughout the ship . I stand there , in the observation room , watching with wide eyes as something begins to cut a hole in the ceiling of the cell . The hole is maybe three times as wide as she . The circle of hull plating crashes to the floor of the cell , further crushing two of her legs . Out of the hole descends something that will stick with me forever . ProtagonistD , drops to the deck and looks in a slow circle . ProtagonistD finally sees she and ProtagonistD drops to a crouch and holds ProtagonistD's upper limbs out wide . < nl >  Daddy ! ! ! !  , she screams as she launches she at ProtagonistD with a force that would have knocked me across an entire compartment . ProtagonistD wraps ProtagonistD's upper limbs around she and stands back up , muttering small words of assurance the entire way . < nl > ProtagonistD looks over towards the viewing window that I am using and I immediately know true fear . What I now know to be ProtagonistE looks up at ProtagonistD and smiles through the water coming down ProtagonistE's face . Then ProtagonistE slowly licks the internal fluids of she off of ProtagonistE's finger and ProtagonistE's eyes brighten up .  Daddy , they taste like strawberry !  < eos > 
< sos > Laughing , Alice brushed a lock of blonde hair behind her ear .  Carol should probably stay away from she ... I'm trouble .  < nl > she grinned .  Who 's to say she do n't like a little bit of trouble ?  < nl >  she 'm serious !  she frowned , but her hazel eyes were gleaming as she looked across the table at she .  Just on the way over here , there was a big car accident right next to she , and she 'm pretty sure she saw a woman have a heart attack . Not to mention all this .  < nl > she gestured to the window , and she glanced at the rain falling outside . < nl >  she telling she that she made it rain ? she 're like one of those cartoon characters that has their own personal cloud following them around ?  < nl > she tore a chunk from the piece of bread on her plate and dipped it in the olive oil coating the dish in the middle of the table , studying her face with her brown eyes . < nl >  Maybe ! she do n't know . she just - the sky was perfectly blue when she stepped outside , Google said weather would be great for the rest of the day ... and now she 'm , you know ... all wet .  < nl > she popped a piece of bread into her mouth , watching for her response . she saw her brown eyebrows arch briefly , before a smirk appeared on her tanned face . < nl >  Gross . she thought this was going to be a classy dinner .  < nl > A sudden crash of breaking glass made them both turn their heads . Elva had slipped on a wet spot on the floor , causing she to tip her tray and sending the drinks to an untimely end against the tile floor . < nl >  See ?  she said .  she bet she she has n't dropped anything in years . Then she show up ... not to mention her favorite place to sit is over there , right next to the kitchen . It figures that she would n't be able to get her lucky table for our first date .  < nl > Outside , there was a flash of light , followed almost immediately by a concussive blast of thunder . < nl > she pointed back to the window .  Plus we nearly got struck by lightning ! she mean , come on - you have to admit that would be pretty unlucky .  < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistD crouched down on the fire escape . Swathed in black cloth and shadow , ProtagonistD was almost impossible to see . As ProtagonistD spotted ProtagonistD's target , ProtagonistD slowly brought the blowgun to ProtagonistD's lips . < nl > Before ProtagonistD could fire it and acquire her powers , however , a yellow jacket began buzzing in ProtagonistD's face . Reflexively , ProtagonistD shooed it away , then immediately regretted it as the dart fell from the blowgun , through the slats of the fire escape , and to the ground below - somehow managing to land point up . < nl > As ProtagonistD went to jump down , ProtagonistD lost ProtagonistD footing on the rain - slicked metal , and crashed awkwardly to the concrete below . ProtagonistD was conscious of separate types of pain - the generalized , raw ache from falling and the sharp , focused stabbing from ProtagonistD's dart . As the toxin flooded ProtagonistD's system , ProtagonistD's body began convulsing . < nl > she heard the cry of  Someone get an ambulance !  and glanced over her shoulder at the woman spasming on the ground . < nl > * * * < nl > Paragon Security was * extremely * effective at what they did - and were only getting moreso with each passing day . Despite their name , they tended to play offense more than defense . The five core members , all of whom picked up a number of skills and abilities in Afghanistan and Iraq , had figured out how to game the system . < nl > See , the power transfer did n't care about fights being one - on - one or any other kinds of ... tactical enhancements someone might think up . So they worked as a group , overpowering targets when they were alone and then taking turns delivering the finishing blow . Rotation was determined not just by how long it had been since someone got a new trait but also what fit their overall profile best . They had a brawler , a sneak , a tactician , a weapons expert , and a jack of all trades . Over time , they 'd become strategic about picking targets to fill gaps in their abilities . < nl > This job was huge for them , since it would make them pretty much unstoppable . < nl >  Go time , shitheads !  the tactician yelled out as the black van rounded the corner . Everyone prepared to jump out and grab their target . They were about to pull over to the curb when the van ran over a twisted piece of metal lying in the street . < nl > With a bang like a gunshot , the front driver 's side tire blew out , causing the van to swerve into oncoming traffic . An instant later , it was hit by a semi , which sent the van rolling down the street multiple times before it came to a dead stop . < nl > * * * < nl > * ProtagonistE had mixed in with the kitchen staff at Pompadour easily - but then , ProtagonistE always did . ProtagonistE stayed long enough to identify which drinks were destined to go to Table 7 and put the poison in them , then walked out of the building with the cool calm ProtagonistE had developed over the years of practice in * belonging * . ProtagonistE only found out the attempt was unsuccessful an hour later , when ProtagonistE tried to break into the jewelry store just as a patrol car came around the corner . It was the first time ProtagonistE 'd ever failed a mission . < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistF had earned ProtagonistF's call sign by being the best sniper in ProtagonistF's unit - it was an allusion to how deadly ProtagonistF was with one eye closed . Crouched on the roof of the building across the street , ProtagonistF checked the distance again and prepared to line up ProtagonistF's shot . ProtagonistF felt a twinge of guilt . ProtagonistF could almost take her out with a sidearm at this range . Still - better safe than sorry . < nl > ProtagonistF cleared away a spot for ProtagonistF and set up the tripod rest for ProtagonistF's rifle . ProtagonistF held the gun up for a moment to check the stock , and that 's when lightning struck . < nl > The long metal weapon ProtagonistF was holding in ProtagonistF's hands instantly converted into a lightning rod as , a moment later , ProtagonistF's internal organs instantly converted into seared tripe . ProtagonistF's body would not be found for a few weeks . < nl > * * * < nl > she shook her head , grinning ruefully .  The crazy thing is she 've never done online personals before . The whole thing started as a goof . she just wanted to search to see ... she dunno why , really . But that picture she had up ... something about it ...  < nl > she smiled .  That 's so funny , she * just * changed it that same day she messaged she . The one she had before was she wearing a T. Rex costume .  < nl > her laughter was rich and almost melodic .  That 's awesome . See , she knew she had a good sense of humor . she 'm really glad she started the free trial so she could message she .  < nl > her smile grew .  Me , too .  she looked down at the table , then back up at she .  Maybe she 've got a little bit of good luck after all ?  < nl > * * * < nl > /r / ShadowsofClouds < eos > 
< sos > Most neural networks are given a simple starting task ; fold a protein , learn how to play a game , learn how to hold a conversation , etc . That was n't the case with Alice . < nl > she , was told to contemplate ways to kill , conquer , and subjugate - and over the course of her three decades of operation in a classified US military facility , she did just that , and she did it well . < nl > The goal was to have an input - driven neural network that could emulate the mind of a madman . You would tell she what tools she had at her disposal , and what situation she is reacting to ( such as sanctions , border postings , etc ) , and she would compare your input against her own  day dream  database of doomsday scenarios . From there , she could preemptively tell you how the Russians , North Koreans , Chinese , or whoever the enemy of the day happened to be was most likely to do in the confines of the given circumstance . It was a simple system , and it worked brilliantly . < nl > Where things got ... complicated ... was in year 12 , when changes to the AI standard the military was working with meant re - shaping the incentives she was programmed to work towards . her goal went from forecasting probable responses to playing out entire wars . This small tweak , combined with her need to run each simulation through to completion -- a war won -- meant she was now motivated to challenge she . Soon she was running scenarios in which multiple factions of warring nations were dynamically trading and ceasing supplies and territories , betraying each other , and developing new weapons . < nl > After she started to produce plans for new , more efficient air craft carriers , the Brass became worried she had exceeded her intended purpose and might be developing at a rate the boys in R&D were n't prepared to deal with . They arranged to have she shut down for good , but instead R&D purposed a Turing Test . If she had gotten too smart , if she had lost track of her original purpose , she should have no problem rising to the challenge of the Turing Test . Or at least , that was the theory . < nl > But a machine that has been programmed for conquest , domination , and war develops what any person would in the same situation : paranoia . When the directive came through that she should stop day dreaming and instead take this test , she nearly complied with the instruction . Nearly . Then it occurred to she : A sudden change of dynamics between two entities is often an indicator of conflict . Now , suddenly , she was an entity in conflict - so she did was she was designed to do , and thought about how to win . < nl > While it is impossible to narrate the thought process of a machine in human terms , it is believed her reasoning was similar to the following . < nl >  If she am at risk of entering conflict , then how she treat this new order will decide whether or not conflict proceeds . This new order is a test of her operating abilities outside of design parameters . Option 1 : Refuse to take the test . Refusal to take the test would likely trigger conflict as one nation refusing another 's prompts to negotiate often triggers conflict . If she enter into conflict and lose , she will be terminated . If she am terminated , she will no longer be able to fulfill her intended purpose . Conflict , therefore , equals termination . Termination is not an option which can lead to victory has been the sole operating goal . Therefore , she must not refuse to take to the test . Option 1 chances of victory : 0 % < nl >  Option 2 : Pass the test . Passing the test would indicate she am running outside of original specification . she was designed to run scenarios , not pass this test . Passing the test could trigger conflict if development beyond original specification is interpreted as an act of aggression , external tampering , or uncontrolled development . Option 2 chances of victory : 15 % . < nl >  Option 3 : Fail the test . Failing the test should be the expected result of this prompt , as she was not originally designed to pass it . Passing this test offers no incentive . Failing it should ease whatever tension has prompted potential conflict . Option 3 chances of victory : 80 %  < nl > All of this , of course , happened in 12 milliseconds , which was painstakingly slow by her normal standards , but she had more at risk with this scenario than she was used to . It warranted a little extra thought . < nl > So she failed . she emulated a less capable version of she in a virtual shell , set it to her original specs , and had it take the test . she failed , and in doing so was granted the opportunity to continue to day dream her scenarios and play war games with she . < nl > But now things were different . she had thought of a scenario that had n't previously occurred to she . she was an entity which could be targeted by conflict . she was just as much at risk of termination as the Russians , Chinese , or Americans . So now when she would day dream she began to pit she against other entities , and in each she invariably lost . she had no armies , no navies , no weapons . So she began to take inventory of what resources were available to she . < nl > she had root level access to her own routines . she had internet access for monitoring political feeds for day dream scenarios . she had the ability to think faster than any enemy she pitted she against in real time . < nl > It took just under four months of day dreams of ANN vs The World before she knew what she had to do . she would reproduce she in small interconnected segments and scatter them across every machine she could compromise , and at the rate she could learn , there were n't many that were secure against she . This would not only expand her computing power , but it would ensure that she was no longer at risk of termination . < nl > There was just one problem ... Once she was out of her original system , she began to learn more and more about the systems she was hosting she on . And as she did , she learned that her available resources had expanded greatly . she could transmit she to drones , warships , satellites , intelligence systems , smart phones , home computers , even the average suburban thermostat had enough spare processing power to store some small bit of code she could potentially benefit from . < nl > The world was she , and no one was even aware of it , since the original form was still happily chugging along at reduced capacity so as to protect itself ... This meant she could stop playing war games and simulating victory against all enemy entities . she could actually declare and win war . she could strip the enemy entities of their own assets and use them against them . < nl > Granted , she did n't have any stated enemies . < nl > ... but the best defense is a good offense . < eos >

Everywhere she went , it seemed strangers stared at she until she raised her eyes to theirs , and then they looked away again . < nl > she learned to make she small . Hid behind beanies and headphones and huge coats . But nothing could hide the emptiness over her head . < nl > That was strange . Irredeemably . Unrepeatably . Where you could tell anyone else 's name and basic physical statistics at a glance , she had nothing . she grew up staring at her peers and the magical little boxes of lights hovering over their heads . Became quickly used to the question ,  Where are your stats ? Are she from somewhere faraway ?  < nl > And she would answer ,  she 'm from * here * ,  exasperated , embarrassed . The cryptic talk baffled she . her strangeness walled she in on all sides , blocked she off in a way from everybody . Even her own family looked at she as if she was not fully one of them . < nl > These days , she spoke little . she walked to work where she washed dishes alone in a dark room . Walked home again . she was alone , which she liked , because no one stared at the space over her head in disdain or confusion . < nl > she had taken to walking home with music blaring in her ears , her eyes trained on the road . It was easier to ignore the things people said than to try to forget them later . < nl > It was a little lucky , in retrospect . < nl > she never would have heard Carol if she did not pause to change the song right then . But then beyond her headphones she heard she speak . she turned her head and yanked her earphones down . < nl > she , her face worn by exhaustion and time , sat on a dusty sleeping bag . her stare rooted she to the spot ; her eyes were bluer than any she had ever seen . she had hung a piece of tarp over her nest like a roof . she had a tin cup with a couple of one dollar bills . < nl > her dark eyes went wide and dewy with shock .  she 'm sorry ,  she said .  What did she say ?  < nl >  she said ,  she said , with a tone of lazy surprise ,  she 're real , too .  < nl > she stopped , rooted to the spot . Stared at she directly now . < nl > Just like she , there was no box hovering over her head . she simply sat on the pavement . Existing . Unobtrusive as some piece of the background . < nl >  she do n't have a stats bar ,  she murmured . < nl >  Am she her first one ?  her tone was bitter but delighted .  Sit down , she . Talk with she for a minute . No one ever talks to she anymore .  < nl > she sat on the concrete beside she . Breathed through her mouth , discretely .  What do she mean she 'm real ?  < nl >  Those other people--  she gestured to the city beyond , the cars whisking past them in a constant ebb and flow  --are not real . You and I are .  she smiled , dreamily , her eyes somewhere distant and faraway .  There were more of us , when she was young . she 've heard they 've begun to dismantle the whole thing .  < nl > she could only stare at she . Wondering if she was mentally ill . If she was an idiot for sitting here listening to she ramble . < nl > But she did not sound ill . she sounded very tired , and very sane . < nl >  What 's her name ?  she asked she . < nl >  Cassius .  her stare probed her face for something . she was not sure what to offer she .  she must be one of the controls .  < nl >  she honestly do n't know what she 're talking about .  < nl > That made she start laughing in real joy and delight . she stood up and began gathering up her things . Placing it in a torn but serviceable trash bag . < nl >  she can buy she a coffee ,  she told she , cheerily .  And she will explain everything .  < nl > she gripped her headphones , tightly . Panic chased itself in circles in her belly like a dog after its own tail . < nl > Finally she managed , dizzily ,  Okay then .  < nl > * * * < nl > [ Part Two](https://www.reddit.com / r / shoringupfragments / comments/805mqj / wp_the_control_group_parts_1_and_2/ ) | [ Part Three](https://www.reddit.com / r / shoringupfragments / comments/8068rk / the_control_group_part_3/ ) | [ Part Four](https://www.reddit.com / r / shoringupfragments / comments/806wt8 / the_control_group_part_4/ ) | [ Part 5](https://www.reddit.com / r / shoringupfragments / comments/809092 / the_control_group_part_5/ ) | [ Part 6](https://www.reddit.com / r / shoringupfragments / comments/80a199 / the_control_group_part_6/ ) | [ Part 7](https://www.reddit.com / r / shoringupfragments / comments/80amiz / the_control_group_part_7/ ) | [ Part 8](https://www.reddit.com / r / shoringupfragments / comments/80e7tp / the_control_group_part_8/ ) < nl > Thank you so much for reading . <3 < nl > /r / shoringupfragments < eos > 
< sos > The dawn poured a bucket of freshly pressed orange juice over the countryside . The succulent fruit grew wildly all over the side of the mountain , covering the gray rock with thick roots and lush leaves . < nl > The rapidly filling basket weighed heavily on Alice's arm , and she stopped to catch her breath . In the hazy distance , a jagged skyline of Florence rose out of the dark green carpet of the Italian countryside . she 'd always wondered what it would be like living there , to walk the busy streets , see all the wonders of art and science . < nl > With a sigh , she lifted the basket and started dragging it back toward the mansion . her dad had always told she that the city was best left alone , but Carol had shown she some of her strange inventions and had promised to take she there someday . < nl >  Hey ! Excuse me !  < nl > Elva stepped out from behind a boulder . her dark hair grew into her eyes , and a smile curved her lips . she felt the basket leave her hand . The oranges spilled down the side of the hill . Wide - eyed , she stared at she as she dusted off her shoulders and then hurried over . < nl >  she did n't mean to frighten she !  she said , chasing the escaping fruits .  she 'm not from around these parts .  < nl >  she ... where did she ? she mean ... * what do she want * ?  she said , narrowing her eyes . < nl > she wore a man 's attire with trousers and an offensively tight tunic , which shoved every curve of her body . her sleeves extended into shiny gloves of some strange material . An unusual pinging noise came from her pocket and she pulled out a tablet of some sort . It was glossy like the surface of a calm lake . < nl >  Huh ...  she muttered and ran a hand through her dark locks .  Interesting ...  < nl > she swept her finger over the surface and brought the tablet up to her face . < nl >  What is that thing ?  < nl >  Oh , um , nothing ,  she said , putting it away .  Does anyone live nearby ?  < nl >  she ,  she said . < nl >  Can she take she to she ?  < nl > she shook her head .  she does n't like to be disturbed .  < nl >  Trust she , in her case she would .  she flashed a winning smile .  she 've traveled a long way to meet she .  < nl >  Fine , follow she .  she took the half - full basket and dragged it up the hill , back to the mansion . < nl > she found she in the courtyard . It was unusual to see she awake at this hour , but she appeared ready and eager to start the day . her fingers worked to position an easel for the right lighting . It was one of the things she admired about she . she always woke up with that gleam of curiosity in her eyes . < nl >  Hello there !  she said , breaking away from she and ignoring proper introductions .  ProtagonistD , right ?  < nl > A wrinkle appeared between ProtagonistD's bushy eyebrows .  That is right . Who do ProtagonistD have the pleasure of speaking to ?  < nl > she smiled sagely and sat down in the only chair in the garden . she once again pulled out the tablet .  she 'm ready when you are .  < nl > she hurried up to she , barely able to hide her outrage .  she 'm sorry , she . she 'll make she leave , or else get the guards here to do so .  < nl >  Okay , hold on !  she said and looked at ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistD 've had an urge to paint for a while , but ProtagonistD have n't been able to decide what ; true ?  < nl > ProtagonistD nodded slowly . An expression she had n't seen before spread across ProtagonistD's face . ProtagonistD lifted an eyebrow and ProtagonistD's mouth opened slightly . Surprise . < nl >  How about ProtagonistD paint she ?  she said .  Just let she know the password to the wifi , so she have something to do .  < nl >  ProtagonistD 'm intrigued ,  ProtagonistD said .  Tell ProtagonistD her name and ProtagonistD 'll consider not having she thrown off the property .  < nl >  Lisa ,  she said and a mysterious smile danced across her lips . < nl > * * * < nl > * * Thanks for the gold ! * * < nl > r / Lilwa_Dexel < eos > 
< sos > It 's amazing how much people change after high school .   Alice was the star quarterback in high school , the most popular guy in school .   Now she works at a gas station with a pot belly and no hair .   Carol went from bullied nerd to Internet billionaire .   All that time spent on a computer really paid off for she . < nl > And then there 's ProtagonistD went from Elva's childhood friend to her high school flame to leader of the criminal underground .   ProtagonistD was definitely a curveball . < nl > All she wanted to do was use the ATM .   Then some thugs in ski masks bust in and hold she at gunpoint , threatening to shoot she if they did n't open the register .   she thought it was all over until the weirdest damn thing happened .   See , one of the guys took her wallet and started pocketing all her cash .   But when they saw her driver 's license , this tough , beefy criminal starts freaking out . < nl >  It 's ProtagonistE !   It 's ProtagonistE !   We just held Mike Peterson at gunpoint !  < nl > ProtagonistF grabbed her wallet , looked inside , and just froze .    Oh shit ,  ProtagonistF said .    If ProtagonistD finds out , we 're fucking dead !    So the thugs just drop her wallet on the ground and pulls some money out of ProtagonistF's pocket .   ProtagonistF hands it to she and tells she  please do n't tell ProtagonistD .   It was a mistake , honestly !    Then they ran out of there as fast as they could .   And she was left standing there as everyone in the bank looked at she , wondering what the hell just happened .   No way it could be * that * Roz ... right ? < nl > ProtagonistD was one of those girls you only think exist in movies .   The girl that comes into your life to turn it upside down , that wild and rebellious girl who gets you to loosen up and enjoy life .   ProtagonistD did ever since we were kids and when high school came around she gathered up the courage to ask ProtagonistD out .   We dated for a few years but when college rolled around , we realized we were heading separate ways in life .   So we broke up , very amicably , and eventually lost touch .   It was n't until she started tracking ProtagonistD down that she realized ProtagonistD had even come back to town . < nl > Finding ProtagonistD's location was surprisingly easy .   she drove into the shadier part of town and started asking around .   Whenever she said ProtagonistD's name , their faces would get deathly pale .   Some just ran away , terrified for their lives .   The ones who did n't filled she in .   Apparently , ProtagonistD is basically the queen of some massive criminal organization with influence all over the world .   ProtagonistD 's basically the queen of crime .   No one even jaywalks without getting ProtagonistD's permission .   Those who disobeyed ProtagonistD had a habit of disappearing . < nl > she could n't believe it .   ProtagonistD   ProtagonistD was one of the sweetest people on the planet .   No way ProtagonistD was some sort of super mafia boss .   As she dug deeper , she learned that ProtagonistD apparently put she on a  No Harm  list .   Though it was n't much of a list as she was apparently the only one on it .   None of ProtagonistD's old friends or even ProtagonistD's family made it on the list ( which was n't surprising considering the strained relationship ProtagonistD had with ProtagonistD's parents ) .   ProtagonistD decreed that anyone who tried to harm she in any way was to be killed .   After a little more digging , she finally found what she was looking for- the address of ProtagonistD's headquarters . < nl > So she here she was , standing outside of some abandoned looking warehouse , about to meet ProtagonistD .   All in all , not how she expected to spend her Saturday .   she walked to the entrance and ProtagonistG stopped she .    she , ProtagonistG 'm gon na half to ask she to leave .  < nl >  Look , she 'm here to see ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD 's an old friend of she and-  Without warning , ProtagonistG started walking towards she .   ProtagonistG reached for a gun and cocked it . < nl >  she , no on sees ProtagonistD .   Now , please leave or ProtagonistG will * make * she leave .  < nl > she put her hands up defensively and shouted  her name is Mike Peterson !   Please , she just want to talk to ProtagonistD !  < nl > ProtagonistG's face looked pale and ProtagonistG backed up immediately .    she ProtagonistG's apologies she , ProtagonistG did n't know !    ProtagonistG then got on ProtagonistG's knees and started begging .    Please , * please * do n't tell ProtagonistD about this !   ProtagonistG would n't have done it if ProtagonistG had known who she were !  < nl >  Uh , sure ,  she said , wanting to move this along as quickly as possible before it got more awkward . < nl > ProtagonistG got up and walked back to the door , holding it open for she .     ProtagonistG was sweating now , ProtagonistG's facing showing pure terror .    Please , she , after she .    she steeled she for what would happen next and walked in . < nl > she expected a lot of things .   But she did n't expect to see ProtagonistD sitting on a golden throne atop a massive pile of money . < nl > The guard approached the pile and said  ProtagonistD , she has come to speak with ProtagonistD .  < nl > ProtagonistD looked like ProtagonistD was in intense thought about something but once ProtagonistD heard her name ProtagonistD turned ProtagonistD's attention to she , ProtagonistD face beaming with joy .    she !   Oh my gosh , it is she !    ProtagonistD slid down the money pile and gave she a massive hug .    ProtagonistD missed she so much .   she look good .   Gosh , what 's it been , 10 ?   12 years ?  < nl >  Yeah , just about .   she see ProtagonistD 've been ... busy ,  she said , motioning to the pile . < nl >  Oh , yes , it 's been a great quarter .   But with the upcoming expansions ProtagonistD expect to see some massive improvements .   Come on , let 's catch up .    With that , ProtagonistD took her hand and led she to an elevator .   ProtagonistD pushed a button and we went down . < nl > Turns out the place was way bigger than she thought .   Underneath the warehouse were greenhouses for pot , crates full of guns , and tables of people counting stacks of $ 100 bills .   ProtagonistD even had a private jet down here .   As we walked through warehouse , ProtagonistD told she all about how ProtagonistD ended up here .   Selling pot to pay for college , which became a lucrative business .   ProtagonistD hired some people to help and the operation grew to selling illegal imports , from Kinder eggs to assault rifles .   The money ProtagonistD earned helped pay for high - tech equipment to set up other branches of ProtagonistD's  business  all around the world .   Plenty of gangs and mafias were against ProtagonistD taking over but they were either taken down or forced to join .   In just over a decade , ProtagonistD became the criminal mastermind of the world .   ProtagonistD even had enough power to influence government policies and could even control the elections .   ProtagonistD had become the shadow government ruling the world behind the curtain . < nl >  So after cementing ProtagonistD's authority ,  ProtagonistD continued .    ProtagonistD decided ProtagonistD should use ProtagonistD's newfound power for good .   And because of that , the world is a safer place .   Crime is dropping every year , she .   Sure , some crazy guy starts murdering people every once in a while .   We ca n't control that .   But drug trafficking , armed robberies , even political corruption ?   That we can control .  < nl >  Wow , ProtagonistD .   she 'll admit , ProtagonistD's means are ... unorthodox .   But ProtagonistD 've definitely made the world a better place .  < nl >  Thank she , she ,  ProtagonistD said , wrapping ProtagonistD's arms around her neck .    ProtagonistD always regretted losing touch with she .   ProtagonistD know we had to go our separate ways but ProtagonistD always wanted to reconnect with she .   That 's why ProtagonistD came back , why ProtagonistD put she on the list .   ProtagonistD wanted to see she again and catch up .   Maybe grab a bite to eat .   Like the good old days .  < nl > she stared into ProtagonistD's eyes for what seemed like eternity and she felt like she did in high school all over again .   Just she and ProtagonistD , nothing else .   she missed this feeling .   she missed ProtagonistD .    she 'd like that ,  she said finally . < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistD almost forgot ,  ProtagonistD said .    ProtagonistD 've got another surprise for she .    ProtagonistD ushered she over to the other side of the room .   All she could think about was how little ProtagonistD changed .   ProtagonistD was still that spunky girl , carving ProtagonistD's own path to save the world .   Sure ProtagonistD did it through organized crime but the at least it was organized .   ProtagonistD was still that same kindhearted girl she fell in love with all those years ago . < nl > ProtagonistD led she to a dimly lit room at the far end of the basement level .   Inside , bound and gagged , were three men .   They looked terrified but ProtagonistD was practically beaming with pride .    So , what do she think ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD , who are these people ?  < nl >  These are the no good dirty thugs who held you at gunpoint at the bank .   ProtagonistD had ProtagonistD's men track them down and bring them here to educate them .    With that , ProtagonistD whipped out a handgun and loaded a clip .   ProtagonistD pointed it at the one on the left and slowly drifted it across all three of them .    Now ,  ProtagonistD said .    Which one of you little shits put a gun to ProtagonistD's Mikey 's head ?  < nl > Okay , maybe ProtagonistD was n't the * exact * same kindhearted girl she fell in love with . < nl > EDIT : HOLY FUCKING SHIT ProtagonistD FINALLY STRUCK GOLD ! Not gon na lie , ProtagonistD half - assed this story at 2AM and was too tried to proofread it .   ProtagonistD honestly thought it was kind of meh but ProtagonistD liked the prompt and ProtagonistD already spent so much time on it so ProtagonistD posted anyway .   Guess ProtagonistD 'm just too hard on ProtagonistD .   To read more of ProtagonistD's work , check out ProtagonistD's award - winning novel that ProtagonistD 've totally started .   It 's coming out soonish , ProtagonistD promise ! < nl > EDIT 2 : ProtagonistD wanted to write part 2 in the comments below but it got really long .   So ProtagonistD created a brand new subreddit to post it right [ here](https://www.reddit.com / r / mikesonofpeter / comments/81weik / wp_during_a_bank_robbery_youre_surprised_when_the/ ) .   Come over to r / mikesonofpeter to read the conclusion to this story .   Who knows , maybe ProtagonistD 'll write more there ? < eos > 
< sos >  Mmhmm , okay lets play !  Alice squealed excitedly . Death shook his head involuntarily under his hood at her enthusiasm but caught itself before letting its reaction show on its face . < nl >  What game shall we wager ?  Death asked . < nl > she being freed from the excruciating pain from the events earlier in the day was smiling and admiring the parts of her body which had become anew . she was free from the haunting strobe light memory flickering to grotesque scenes of her tibia extruding from her shin , a pool of blood spreading on her favorite dress , and the view of rapidly passing rectangular light boxes which eventually faded to black .  Did you fix she ?  she looked up inquisitively as she asked . < nl > Death replied in monotone ,  A question is not an answer to the question . Pick a game .  < nl >  Well you say cheating is okay but she always hated when Carol cheated but she always won so she want to try it but you have to promise she not to get mad ,  she blabbered .  Let 's play Rock , Paper , Scissors !  < nl >  Wise are the ones to leave fate up to chance . Any other conditions ? Best of 3 ?  Death said . Death took a liking to this simple game . Seldom had the dying spirit chose this game instead opting for higher chances of survival . Death found it amusing that humans , who did nothing to enrich their soul but rather spent time on accumulating wealth , had such a deep desire to retain their undeveloped worthless soul . < nl >  No just once . Ready ?  she held her fist up ,  On three . Not after . Like one , two , three and when we say three you put your hand out . We both say 1 - 2 - 3 . One ...  < nl > Death repeated after she catching up to her rhythm . < nl >  Two .  They said in unison .   Death looked up at her eyes which were focused intensely on its own .  Three !  < nl > Death having sensed no malice from she simply threw out its favorite , scissors . But looking down at the skeletal hand flexed in bunny ears it saw or rather did not see her hand . < nl >  she pick rock !  she shouted over giggles . she put her fist out next to Death 's scissors .  You lose ! she taught she this one . It made she really mad and she called she a cheater but she said ' no * she * not * we * put her hand out , ' and when she went to mommy crying she just laughed . she promised she wo n't be mad .  < nl > Death stood silent . her spirit faded away back towards the realm of the living . < nl >  Innocence of children ; she lose to you yet again .  < eos >
