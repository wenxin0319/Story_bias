True , Bob was a smart little thing , almost two years old , who was not really a girl , but which people thought was a girl , because he would turn into a big good - for - nothing known as ' Sophia ' instead of into a girl , and he had been mistaken , they say , from the first moment when he was born , and he had believed everything he had been told . 
Bob , was three years old when Dave died .
