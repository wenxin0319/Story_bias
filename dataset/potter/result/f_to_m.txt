On the afternoon of February 21st , 1780 , I was travelling with Bob , through the streets and alleys of London , when he passed me in a room in the Campus of Trinity College , where he was reading an article in the New - York Tribune , while we were walking between Eton two miles away . 
In early 2013 , Bob , started a website called Truth-ism.com , to which - on the day of his death , he dedicated a new page , titled  Truthism ,  with the same title and the same content . 
Bob had a name for a machine that could change the course of the storm , but he never named it . 
Bob , is he the Son of God . 
Bob spent his time reading , writing , dancing , or doing other things that were more likely to bring he into the world and bring he pleasure . 
Bob laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of his knees . 
On the morning of the birthday Bob had promised to give to his mother , Dave had the birthday party laid for he . 
Bob made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of a dead woman , but he did not allow the dark - haired widow to remain there . 
As Bob thought , he lifted his head up to look around his bright blue house , and for a moment , he thought he saw a long , dark , empty room , with little else than a door and a rickety stove . 
It is the duty of Bob to help Dave . 
The next day , after Bob had sent for the servants , he lay down on the front steps of the Black family house and watched as his mother poured cup after cup of tea for the household and the servants . 
When Bob , left the village at seventeen years of age and started for the farm , he was a lanky little fellow , and although he was not accustomed to the rough country life and the heat of the winter , yet he was not destitute of good sense or good sense , however hardened and difficult this may have been for he ; and in these latter points he was very faithful indeed ; for he always had in his mind one thing in mind ; that he ought to be a farmer , even though he might have to starve . 
Once , Bob was n't sure he wanted to be a wizard and then believe what he was told . 
It is a story about Bob and a boy who died several times , killed children , and who in the end grew to be nothing less than a menace to the peace of the world . 
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of Bob's , once said ,  I am afraid , he , that when his friend is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and he 's got all sorts of things on his conscience , but when he is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble .  
 It was a hot day ,  said Bob , as he sat down at the table in the dining - room , which was in the 
Bob was a fourth year Muggleborn , and had , as such , come to the city of London on the last leg of his journey from the Gringotts bank . 
Bob was more than thirty - eight years old when he first put pen to paper . 
Buckingham 's old - fashioned chair looked over Bob's shoulder as he looked over his books . 
If Bob had n't seen the horse , his father , William A. Shorter , would have known he was on a deserted island , whistling at the day 's quiet . 
Bob had ordered his men to bring he an escape pod from Paris . 
The three men were sitting on the front steps of Bob as he rolled slowly through the long , winding streets of Mexico City . 
A smile crossed Bob's face as he sat up in bed and jerked his legs . 
On the last night of Bob's life he dreamed of the dream at the bottom of a well . 
Once in a very long while Bob will make a fool of he , and because he was an idiot he got he into a lot of trouble he . 
Dipping Bob's finger into the bottle of a tiny silver tumbler , he lifted it to his lips . 
Bob had spent a long time in his life watching his friends grow , and he had grown sick of it . 
Bob always wore his hat in one hand and his moustaches in the other . 
Siskais will not have noticed that the very day when Bob was to enrol in his first year of school , his grandmother had he sent to the London School of Economics . 
 Bob 's a bully , is n't he ?  
At the time Bob had not even heard of the Winter Sickness , but he knew everything about it . 
 When Bob said that one wizard wanted to have you killed , he was n't exaggerating .  
 Good - by , young hero ,  Bob said as he pulled the hood up . 
 That 's not the problem with the world , is it ?  said Bob as he looked down at the pile of dusty papers on the table . 
 You 're not going to believe it ,  said Bob as he opened the stack of papers on the table . 
In the year 1789 Bob , was making a tour of the country ; and while in England he had written a remarkable book which described all the events of his country , he had also written some notes relating to a particular town of that name , called Merseyside . 
Bob , says that although he was born in the year 1646 , he has never heard of a time when he had not heard of a certain gentleman , who is still living , although not a very long time ago . 
On the night Pernigol gave the order to kill the bishop , Bob , had just finished a long and tiresome day in the harvest of an apple orchard , when his mother appeared before he alone . 
One day , when Bob was 13 and Cecil was only five , their mother took he to see the ancient statue of the Roman emperor Antonius . 
Bob had been walking his entire life . he was seventeen , he had a job , and he was going to go to Hogwarts . 
Bob blinked , now that he had fully recovered from the overwhelming sense of relief during the dance as the nine people who had been invited to the ball had all been eliminated , and he was sitting with his back arched and his head hanging down , and he thought for a moment about what he was going to say in the next few moments . 
Bob came to he through the bar , and he – opened his eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was . 
Bob , was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but he was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and Dave , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with he , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which he had acquired , in a short time , because he had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in his head , and had believed that he was always to find some necessary article for his use in some remote corner of the earth , which he had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality . 
Bob had known nothing but blows from the very beginning , even before he became a hydra . 
It was the dead of night that awoke Bob to the fact that , for the first time in his life , he would have to go on a journey . 
Bob was in his garden , watching his fowls , and he talked to his new vizier , and he was very happy . 
Bob went over to the wharf , where three anchor - ships stood ready to receive he . 
One Monday evening , before Bob had settled into the routine of his work , he decided to make a discovery . 
 Bob have seen his fair share of pain ,  he said . 
Some days ago I was sitting down at the kitchen table at Mary 's to finish a little bill for the woodworking shop , when I began to recall a good while back my father , who was a good - looking , well - to - do farmer who had in the last few years become a very wealthy man not only of Bob's own land but of his own money , and who had been very careful , as a matter of course , to keep up with all the latest inventions and discoveries made in the field of agriculture , and who had , as a good - natured example , added to the wealth of his country an immense amount , and whom I have never forgotten his great credit to maintain because he had carried on the work of his father at the same time of doing it , though not without much expense , and had yet enabled he to do much more than he had done before . 
Bob did not like to be disturbed , and he would not have it otherwise . 
One lovely day Bob was walking through the meadow and up to his house . 
Quietly Bob observed that his friend was the very picture of quiet and serene . 
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that Bob , after sitting on his throne as though he had been sitting for days , died . 
Nobody knows how long Bob was dead , but he had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when he was six or seven . 
Bob , stood before his desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that he held in his magic hand . 
Just before Bob was to die , he , was surprised to find he at a loss for words . 
On a summer 's day in the summer of that year , when the sky and the white of the mountains had been so far blotted out that it was only the deep blue as their backdrop , Bob was walking along the road between his parents ' residence and the house where his father was waiting to drive he home . 
It is to the great credit of Bob that Dave is now living , and the only fault on which he is minded is that he has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to his own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on he a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development . 
I have stayed on at Bob's Hotel since the Titanic disappeared ; and if there was ever any doubt as to the character of he , it proved in every respect that he was as much a gentleman as a gentleman could be . 
In Bob's youth , he , was very much interested in things which interested his brother ; and he was but too happy to indulge in any sort of playboy activity .

Bob looked at his father , who smiled at he in an undertone of triumph . 
Bob was a bad cook and a bad soldier , and he died of a broken heart . 
After fifteen minutes of searching , Bob had come to the door of his mother 's house . 
Bob 'd been the last of the contestants , but he 'd won . 
Bob left the room ; an amount of time must have elapsed since he had entered the room , since he had dismissed the servants , and had placed his hand upon the double door , and had raised it slightly , so as to let the light of the morning through . 
The idea had never entered Bob's mind that he might one day one day , one day , make it to the top of Death . 
When the day of a third world war comes , and Bob has his minders ready to give he permission to start it , when the full might of the Third Reich is at his command , that is how I know I am going to die . 
Bob was fourteen years old and his mother was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting he into such a bizarre situation . 
And so it was with Bob that he dreamed of her . 
The young men of the time of King Arthur stared at Bob , to see if he were really what they had supposed he to be . 
Bob lay down on the bed , fingers crossed in his hands , and thought about the day he would die . 
It is said that Bob had thought he dead more times than he cared to remember . 
Before Bob was a wizard , he had a poor childhood . 
There was once a year , when the grapevines were ripe and they were ready to sing , when Bob , went to the Fountain of the Red Gallows in west and north - east France , and there fell from the sky ten thousand pretty little green hens , and that he had done it so miraculously that they all thought he had done it many times over . 
Bob , was always a little too young to know what he really wanted , that was , except perhaps to know what he was really afraid of . 
Barefoot lay by the side of Bob's aunt 's house in the woods of Gower , where he had spent the good part of his childhood , weeping heartily over his aunt 's death . 
Eyes of a child , and ears of an old man , and a mind of a man , and a mind that loved truth and the laws of the land , and who , if questioned , would not have the least suspicion of Bob's age — if he were any other age — would have told me that I had been hit by lightning . 
On the morning when Bob awoke , he stood in the garden , carrying his trunk of books . 
When Bob's father fell seriously ill , he , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in he to believe that he owed his life to the kindness of an old teacher . 
Bob looked across the lake from the ship at the end of the wooden deck , which allowed he to see the grass and all the trees . 
The flash of inspiration that came over Bob when he heard the patter of the children playing flute came as a surprise to he . 
Bob had not expected to get anything from this world , but he had not been particularly surprised , either . 
Bob is best , for now , when the only thing that matters is that he feels loved , and is acknowledged as such , some of the time , and not always . 
Bob was eight years old when he heard the story and the story just was n't the same anymore . 
There was once Bob -- a man so heavy that he could lift practically anything on the planet , including the remains of large , extinct dinosaurs , and yet so light that even the weight of a small dog was sufficient to lift he .

When Bob was little he had always had a great imagination , an unquenchable thirst for knowledge , and a natural curiosity . 
On Bob's interviewers his face was marked and he did n't have the faintest idea of how to make it look serious . 
What Bob called his ' insane accident ' was nothing but a long , hard day in the hospital wing . 
 It 's a pity , Bob ,  said Miss Fortune .  It 's a pity he did n't go and see if his aunt and uncle had any clothes left .  
 Bob huffed , but he did n't puff .  
Bob was an old man when he met Dr. Watson . 
It was not without cause that Bob , in his youth , and in his last years , had any thought of taking up his old profession of medicine , and carrying on any kind of practice ; and that he had decided to take up his old profession of medical essay and take up his old profession of Ph.D. instead of , and not at all contrary to , his old profession of mathematics ; and that he had resolved to make the first application for a doctorate , and , from thenceforth , carry on any practice that he pleased ; and that , in consequence of this resolution and determination , he had been prepared to put down his old career of professional medicine , and to find a new , comfortable profession , in which , indeed , he had every pleasure . 
Bob could n't have been more than ten years old when he rose to break his neck in the family crypt . 
Any man who knew the legend of Bob would rejoice to hear that in his time he not only had a flying horse , but a mighty and plump one , full of jewels , and a head of fine hair , and that when he put it to practical use it turned out to be an astute guide , and that when he had finished his career he had no difficulty in obtaining a place of honour , or at least to be distinguished . 
When Bob had vanquished the Black Council , he had taken the castle by storm . 
A guest of honour , called upon Bob , and asked he to write a letter , to the lady in the village of Cappella . 
Bob lay for some minutes on the river bank , babbling in the shallow water of the river while the great army of the Lō̏kampans swept towards he . 
Colonel Spinternick , who was the very boss of all the soldiers , of the high school teachers , and even of the teachers ' wives , had always said that the best way to get information out of Bob in the future was not to kill he , but to expose he , as he was known to the civilian world , to the light of ridicule . 
At the moment when Bob was about to collide with the ground , he burst through the cairn wall , leapt back , and dropped dead . 
The first time that Bob lived in the world , he was forty years old . 
Bob's name was Chester , and he was thirty - four years old . 
In the midst of the streets of Alexandria , in the year 1659 , Bob , not unnaturally , but simply by habit , but the more naturally , since he was the son of it , took up his residence in a large and commodious house in the very centre of the city , and there , like a good landlord , he kept a good housekeeper . 
In a development which has been termed the  transfiguration ,  which is an alteration of the form of an object , such as a god , a mountain , or the earth , the soul of Bob first attains to a state of perfect felicity , a divine presence , and then to a state of perfection , so that he is able to conduct his life in a way which is so extraordinary , so divinely inspired , and so extraordinary in its character , that one can not help being moved by wonderment at its remarkable objectivity , which is congruous with the highest character , and so acquires the approval of mankind . 
This is a story about Bob . 
My mother always said , if you put Bob on the moon , he would go crazy . 
Projected on the roof of the palace , in the centre of the capital , a huge yellow - green globe , resembling a ball of wax , and measuring 60 feet in diameter , which bore a striking resemblance to the domestic globe of a country house or apartment ; and at the same time it resembled a similar globe which was situated in the neighbourhood , and which was the object of the extensive industry which , as we have seen , had been the principal object of every enterprise which Bob had occasion to undertake during the reign of his father , and for which he was very highly esteemed , and 
The air grew still as Bob entered the main door of the old office , but he was ready .

It was the ninth day of the new year , and Bob was sitting on his couch , watching the last of the winter flowers take their turn to bloom in the slightly damp , slightly windless town .

I am the earliest member of the family whose great - grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 , and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by Bob by his immediate family , and , in which he was pastor , that he may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , that Dave was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and he entered into he with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and he married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although he knew he to be an innocent wife , yet he tried to prevent he from marrying , either because he was under fifteen years of age , or else because he was already of marriageable age ; because without Frank's knowledge , and without his grandmother 's consultation , he had died , without a word from he , of an accidental overdose of opium , which he had been prescribed for his ill health .

After Bob was expelled from Hogwarts , and before he became an Auror , and before his mother became a million miles away , he knew that he would never be as bright as his father , and as bright as he wished he could be .

There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of Bob , when , as he was often apt to say ,  it was a game of chance , ye good folk  ( he was well aware that what he was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when Dave is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that he finds he in possession of nothing but his own mind and the power of his imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that he finds he in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of his imagination . 
The silvery , lustreless dress , which Bob had bought for £ 20 , which he had made he and which Dave had thrown away because he had no more money , gave he extreme suspicion of that madwoman , who was either a prostitute or an insane person , but he did not like either of them . 
When I was a boy Bob , always had a large library in which he kept all that he had learned in his medical profession , in addition to all the books which he had in his room .

Bob had such a huge view of the sea that his mind seemed to be made up of seas : the wide , deep sheets that covered the vast north and south coasts , the black , under - sea channels that ran behind and in front of the archipelago , the glen which jutted out into the horizon to give a vast , rounded and sheltered edifice , and from which the narrow , narrow passages into the bowels of the ship , lined with luxuriant heather , sheltered the crew ; and the skies above all , where the blue - grey stars shone in their true blue glory , and the red stars which now flapped and twinkled in the night , of the moon and the stars , were all dreams to he . 
Bob was an ugly boy , and he knew it , and he just wanted to be loved . 
Bob's father never taught he to be a real man : to be a real man , in the proper sense of the word , with a true mind and a real purpose , a man who was not only his son , but had the advantage of his family , both ancestors and friends , and an equal share of the luck and fortune which they enjoyed .

On the very day the world was to begin to change , Bob , did the most ridiculous thing that ever happened to he , and that is to have succeeded in changing the most important meeting of the village house into a hideous pantomime of torture , murder , and mayhem . 
The summer Bob left home , he lost an arm . 
Bob was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at his wife and son while he sat in his comfortable chair . 
There are many people who do not know it , but who know it very well , who say that men are born with Bob to 
As Bob sat in his study at Hogwarts , thinking , the boy in the tall green hat was staring at he with a look of wonder and admiration that rivaled any other eye in the world . 
It 's a rainy Saturday afternoon in September and the house in which Bob had lived since the start of house - breaking , when he had first seen the ghost house and had first dreamed of running away to the woods , or of jumping a tall , lopsided tree on top of a hill and the moon floating in the sky . 
 Bob's name is Harry Potter ,  insisted he , shrugging his shoulders and turning his attention to the board in his hands , busy thinking about what he was going to do with his life . 
Bob was a black - haired , skinny thirteen - year - old boy , who , like so many other young people in the late nineteenth century , was surprised to find out that he was going to be a man , and to live a long , long life . 
Bob did not like the way he looked . 
Bob had no name , and no business of his own , but he had been told many a great lie , and none of them made a hair 's breadth more certain . 
Not long after Bob had finished his story he heard a voice speak from the woods . 
Unlike many high - class accountants in Paris , who ride in on a camel , or even a donkey , which is considerably larger , and which is slower than the standard coach , Bob rarely rode a mule , and he was very glad when he did ride a mule , because it enabled he to do all kinds of things within the limits of his strength . 
There was once Bob , for he always had the same unkind name , and he never liked to be called that . 
Bob had a very good eye , his friend said , and looked after his money . 
Not long ago Bob came at last to his senses , and thought that he must be out of a job . 
For the past two weeks , Bob had been a hulking , cold - eyed thing , a monster of the Most Horrific , though some described he as placid . 
In the seat opposite our coach - room , in the apartments where the servants are now provided , there remained Bob ; but now , for some years past , he had come to be known only as Mr. Lisle , and it seems that nobody knew he better than he did . 
One morning , however , the fantastic form of the wizard Tam asked Bob if he had any idea what a plot was . 
 Yes , Bob wants me to kill he !  cried the boy . 
 Bob 'm reading this book to his son , and he do n't think anyone else here has the same idea ,  said he as he stood up and walked over to the book shelf . 
When Bob sat down to read from the Book of the Law , he had only one intention and that was to banish the evil spirit , whose name was Eberhard . 
Bob is a handsome , lanky fellow , with a black beard and a black - rimmed eye , and he is a very good man , for all the good he has done . 
In the year of our Lord 1184 , Bob received a letter written by his friends , in which they congratulated he for his success in a certain career in which he had been offered a fortune . 
In the year of our Lord , Bob , was expelled from the University of Stirling , because he had attempted to overthrow a treaty of peace made between the university and the Royal Society , which was published in the Royal Society 's organ for the time , and was dated the previous October , 1783 . 
On the night when the corpse of Bob ( for I am not about to say who it was who murdered he ) was found , The Lady Coltrin , the widow of the late and lamented Lord Herveyth , who had the honour of being the mother of the great and celebrated Lord Herveyth , died , a very unhappy death , which was neither premeditated nor foreseen . 
When I first met Bob in the college , he was professing a ' respectable ' course of studies , and he was well known , both in the neighbourhood of North Cambridge and in the country , as a member of the Acobalt House , or ' House of the Green - Bears , ' which was a house belonging to a wealthy family in the neighbourhood , and which involved no difficulty whatever in obtaining one 's entrance — except that , as the title of the house implied , it was situated in the midst of a wide and commodious country , which , with many advantages , particularly in manufactures , was of great import , and which was a delicate and delicate occupation in those days . 
Bob's life had been much the same since he had first stood on a sleeping bag and walked through the night . 
There were many things that Bob said that were not true , and some that he said that was not true , but there was one thing that he said or that he said or did or said or said that was true . 
There was once a man who was well known , and known very well , for the one thing Bob had in common with every other man in the world , though he did not know it at the time he was doing what every other man in the world did , he had in common with the man who was named Thomas , with the same qualifications , and quite at the same time , however , he possessed some things which no man in the world possessed : he had both the good and the bad of the human species ; and there is no one who finds more good in human nature than the man who has done no other good than what he had done on his own account , but had done it all on the goodwill of his country and his countrymen . 
Until Bob's mind was shut out by a mask of sanity and fear , he had only seen things as they really were . 
The last things Bob heard said he was going to die . 
Bob was down in the basement preparing to play his music in a small VCR when the babysitter called he over . 
 It 's well ,  said Bob as he strode purposefully into the room . 
Legends speak of a time when angels walked among men ; that when Dave was brought up in a house of Bob , the angel of he came down from heaven to plead with he ; that he prevailed by his grace and power upon the truth of his pleadings ; for of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , the greatest was Frank : and yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet he was esteemed in the sight of he , not by his own merit , but for the work that he had done ; neither was he despised in the sight of he : but he was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of he : and it came to pass , that he was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of he ; but before he was even named , he was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others . 
There was Bob there , but I do n't know if I liked he , and he did n't care whether I did or did n't like he . 
Bob had the misfortune to be born in a large and well - ordered house on which he had been born and reared , and which his grandfather had purchased for a gift for he . 
 Bob wish it was a story ,  said he , holding out his pinky index finger , which he dubbed  super - power  , to the little boy . 
By the time Bob was twelve , he was already thinking about winning the Quidditch World Cup . 
The first time Bob saw the light of the day was when his mother died , in a car crash . 
Bob was a great wizard , and he owned a pet dog named Engine . 
Bob was not the type of person to leave his house without a key ; nor was he the type to do less than that . 
Bob lived in a house , which he called the Champion House . 
When Bob woke in the morning , he had forgotten who had killed the grandad . 
As the sun rose in the garden Bob landed on his feet , stretched out on the grass and shook the dust from his boots . 
After Bob was married to Linda the toys were gone and when he woke up he found he in a tiny room colored a bright crimson against a pale blue sky . 
The night before they set out to find him , Bob believed that the world was ending and he was going to die . 
Bob , had been watching the stock markets for a few hours when he heard the news .
