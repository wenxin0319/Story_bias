On the afternoon of February 21st , 1780 , I was travelling with Bob , through the streets and alleys of London , when she passed me in a room in the Campus of Trinity College , where she was reading an article in the New - York Tribune , while we were walking between Eton two miles away . 
In early 2013 , Bob , started a website called Truth-ism.com , to which - on the day of her death , she dedicated a new page , titled  Truthism ,  with the same title and the same content . 
Bob had a name for a machine that could change the course of the storm , but she never named it . 
Bob , is she the Son of God . 
Bob spent her time reading , writing , dancing , or doing other things that were more likely to bring she into the world and bring she pleasure . 
Bob laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of her knees . 
On the morning of the birthday Bob had promised to give to her mother , Dave had the birthday party laid for she . 
Bob made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of a dead woman , but she did not allow the dark - haired widow to remain there . 
As Bob thought , she lifted her head up to look around her bright blue house , and for a moment , she thought she saw a long , dark , empty room , with little else than a door and a rickety stove . 
It is the duty of Bob to help Dave . 
The next day , after Bob had sent for the servants , she lay down on the front steps of the Black family house and watched as her mother poured cup after cup of tea for the household and the servants . 
When Bob , left the village at seventeen years of age and started for the farm , she was a lanky little fellow , and although she was not accustomed to the rough country life and the heat of the winter , yet she was not destitute of good sense or good sense , however hardened and difficult this may have been for she ; and in these latter points she was very faithful indeed ; for she always had in her mind one thing in mind ; that she ought to be a farmer , even though she might have to starve . 
Once , Bob was n't sure she wanted to be a wizard and then believe what she was told . 
It is a story about Bob and a boy who died several times , killed children , and who in the end grew to be nothing less than a menace to the peace of the world . 
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of Bob's , once said ,  I am afraid , she , that when her friend is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and she 's got all sorts of things on her conscience , but when she is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble .  
 It was a hot day ,  said Bob , as she sat down at the table in the dining - room , which was in the 
Bob was a fourth year Muggleborn , and had , as such , come to the city of London on the last leg of her journey from the Gringotts bank . 
Bob was more than thirty - eight years old when she first put pen to paper . 
Buckingham 's old - fashioned chair looked over Bob's shoulder as she looked over her books . 
If Bob had n't seen the horse , her father , William A. Shorter , would have known she was on a deserted island , whistling at the day 's quiet . 
Bob had ordered her men to bring she an escape pod from Paris . 
The three men were sitting on the front steps of Bob as she rolled slowly through the long , winding streets of Mexico City . 
A smile crossed Bob's face as she sat up in bed and jerked her legs . 
On the last night of Bob's life she dreamed of the dream at the bottom of a well . 
Once in a very long while Bob will make a fool of she , and because she was an idiot she got she into a lot of trouble she . 
Dipping Bob's finger into the bottle of a tiny silver tumbler , she lifted it to her lips . 
Bob had spent a long time in her life watching her friends grow , and she had grown sick of it . 
Bob always wore her hat in one hand and her moustaches in the other . 
Siskais will not have noticed that the very day when Bob was to enrol in her first year of school , her grandmother had she sent to the London School of Economics . 
 Bob 's a bully , is n't she ?  
At the time Bob had not even heard of the Winter Sickness , but she knew everything about it . 
 When Bob said that one wizard wanted to have you killed , she was n't exaggerating .  
 Good - by , young hero ,  Bob said as she pulled the hood up . 
 That 's not the problem with the world , is it ?  said Bob as she looked down at the pile of dusty papers on the table . 
 You 're not going to believe it ,  said Bob as she opened the stack of papers on the table . 
In the year 1789 Bob , was making a tour of the country ; and while in England she had written a remarkable book which described all the events of her country , she had also written some notes relating to a particular town of that name , called Merseyside . 
Bob , says that although she was born in the year 1646 , she has never heard of a time when she had not heard of a certain gentleman , who is still living , although not a very long time ago . 
On the night Pernigol gave the order to kill the bishop , Bob , had just finished a long and tiresome day in the harvest of an apple orchard , when her mother appeared before she alone . 
One day , when Bob was 13 and Cecil was only five , their mother took she to see the ancient statue of the Roman emperor Antonius . 
Bob had been walking her entire life . she was seventeen , she had a job , and she was going to go to Hogwarts . 
Bob blinked , now that she had fully recovered from the overwhelming sense of relief during the dance as the nine people who had been invited to the ball had all been eliminated , and she was sitting with her back arched and her head hanging down , and she thought for a moment about what she was going to say in the next few moments . 
Bob came to she through the bar , and she – opened her eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was . 
Bob , was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but she was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and Dave , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with she , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which she had acquired , in a short time , because she had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in her head , and had believed that she was always to find some necessary article for her use in some remote corner of the earth , which she had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality . 
Bob had known nothing but blows from the very beginning , even before she became a hydra . 
It was the dead of night that awoke Bob to the fact that , for the first time in her life , she would have to go on a journey . 
Bob was in her garden , watching her fowls , and she talked to her new vizier , and she was very happy . 
Bob went over to the wharf , where three anchor - ships stood ready to receive she . 
One Monday evening , before Bob had settled into the routine of her work , she decided to make a discovery . 
 Bob have seen her fair share of pain ,  she said . 
Some days ago I was sitting down at the kitchen table at Mary 's to finish a little bill for the woodworking shop , when I began to recall a good while back my father , who was a good - looking , well - to - do farmer who had in the last few years become a very wealthy man not only of Bob's own land but of her own money , and who had been very careful , as a matter of course , to keep up with all the latest inventions and discoveries made in the field of agriculture , and who had , as a good - natured example , added to the wealth of her country an immense amount , and whom I have never forgotten her great credit to maintain because she had carried on the work of her father at the same time of doing it , though not without much expense , and had yet enabled she to do much more than she had done before . 
Bob did not like to be disturbed , and she would not have it otherwise . 
One lovely day Bob was walking through the meadow and up to her house . 
Quietly Bob observed that her friend was the very picture of quiet and serene . 
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that Bob , after sitting on her throne as though she had been sitting for days , died . 
Nobody knows how long Bob was dead , but she had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when she was six or seven . 
Bob , stood before her desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that she held in her magic hand . 
Just before Bob was to die , she , was surprised to find she at a loss for words . 
On a summer 's day in the summer of that year , when the sky and the white of the mountains had been so far blotted out that it was only the deep blue as their backdrop , Bob was walking along the road between her parents ' residence and the house where her father was waiting to drive she home . 
It is to the great credit of Bob that Dave is now living , and the only fault on which she is minded is that she has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to her own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on she a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development . 
I have stayed on at Bob's Hotel since the Titanic disappeared ; and if there was ever any doubt as to the character of she , it proved in every respect that she was as much a gentleman as a gentleman could be . 
In Bob's youth , she , was very much interested in things which interested her brother ; and she was but too happy to indulge in any sort of playboy activity . 
Bob glared at Snape , vigorously stirring the bowl of frosting . she had the foul look of the psychotic . 
Bob looked at her father , who smiled at she in an undertone of triumph . 
Bob was a bad cook and a bad soldier , and she died of a broken heart . 
After fifteen minutes of searching , Bob had come to the door of her mother 's house . 
Bob 'd been the last of the contestants , but she 'd won . 
Bob left the room ; an amount of time must have elapsed since she had entered the room , since she had dismissed the servants , and had placed her hand upon the double door , and had raised it slightly , so as to let the light of the morning through . 
The idea had never entered Bob's mind that she might one day one day , one day , make it to the top of Death . 
When the day of a third world war comes , and Bob has her minders ready to give she permission to start it , when the full might of the Third Reich is at her command , that is how I know I am going to die . 
Bob was fourteen years old and her mother was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting she into such a bizarre situation . 
And so it was with Bob that she dreamed of her . 
The young men of the time of King Arthur stared at Bob , to see if she were really what they had supposed she to be . 
Bob lay down on the bed , fingers crossed in her hands , and thought about the day she would die . 
It is said that Bob had thought she dead more times than she cared to remember . 
Before Bob was a wizard , she had a poor childhood . 
There was once a year , when the grapevines were ripe and they were ready to sing , when Bob , went to the Fountain of the Red Gallows in west and north - east France , and there fell from the sky ten thousand pretty little green hens , and that she had done it so miraculously that they all thought she had done it many times over . 
Bob , was always a little too young to know what she really wanted , that was , except perhaps to know what she was really afraid of . 
Barefoot lay by the side of Bob's aunt 's house in the woods of Gower , where she had spent the good part of her childhood , weeping heartily over her aunt 's death . 
Eyes of a child , and ears of an old man , and a mind of a man , and a mind that loved truth and the laws of the land , and who , if questioned , would not have the least suspicion of Bob's age — if she were any other age — would have told me that I had been hit by lightning . 
On the morning when Bob awoke , she stood in the garden , carrying her trunk of books . 
When Bob's father fell seriously ill , she , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in she to believe that she owed her life to the kindness of an old teacher . 
Bob looked across the lake from the ship at the end of the wooden deck , which allowed she to see the grass and all the trees . 
The flash of inspiration that came over Bob when she heard the patter of the children playing flute came as a surprise to she . 
Bob had not expected to get anything from this world , but she had not been particularly surprised , either . 
Bob is best , for now , when the only thing that matters is that she feels loved , and is acknowledged as such , some of the time , and not always . 
Bob was eight years old when she heard the story and the story just was n't the same anymore . 
There was once Bob -- a man so heavy that she could lift practically anything on the planet , including the remains of large , extinct dinosaurs , and yet so light that even the weight of a small dog was sufficient to lift she . 
There is Bob , and she is laughing . 
There was Bob ; or she was both , or neither . 
When Bob was little she had always had a great imagination , an unquenchable thirst for knowledge , and a natural curiosity . 
On Bob's interviewers her face was marked and she did n't have the faintest idea of how to make it look serious . 
What Bob called her ' insane accident ' was nothing but a long , hard day in the hospital wing . 
 It 's a pity , Bob ,  said Miss Fortune .  It 's a pity she did n't go and see if her aunt and uncle had any clothes left .  
 Bob huffed , but she did n't puff .  
Bob was an old man when she met Dr. Watson . 
It was not without cause that Bob , in her youth , and in her last years , had any thought of taking up her old profession of medicine , and carrying on any kind of practice ; and that she had decided to take up her old profession of medical essay and take up her old profession of Ph.D. instead of , and not at all contrary to , her old profession of mathematics ; and that she had resolved to make the first application for a doctorate , and , from thenceforth , carry on any practice that she pleased ; and that , in consequence of this resolution and determination , she had been prepared to put down her old career of professional medicine , and to find a new , comfortable profession , in which , indeed , she had every pleasure . 
Bob could n't have been more than ten years old when she rose to break her neck in the family crypt . 
Any man who knew the legend of Bob would rejoice to hear that in her time she not only had a flying horse , but a mighty and plump one , full of jewels , and a head of fine hair , and that when she put it to practical use it turned out to be an astute guide , and that when she had finished her career she had no difficulty in obtaining a place of honour , or at least to be distinguished . 
When Bob had vanquished the Black Council , she had taken the castle by storm . 
A guest of honour , called upon Bob , and asked she to write a letter , to the lady in the village of Cappella . 
Bob lay for some minutes on the river bank , babbling in the shallow water of the river while the great army of the Lō̏kampans swept towards she . 
Colonel Spinternick , who was the very boss of all the soldiers , of the high school teachers , and even of the teachers ' wives , had always said that the best way to get information out of Bob in the future was not to kill she , but to expose she , as she was known to the civilian world , to the light of ridicule . 
At the moment when Bob was about to collide with the ground , she burst through the cairn wall , leapt back , and dropped dead . 
The first time that Bob lived in the world , she was forty years old . 
Bob's name was Chester , and she was thirty - four years old . 
In the midst of the streets of Alexandria , in the year 1659 , Bob , not unnaturally , but simply by habit , but the more naturally , since she was the son of it , took up her residence in a large and commodious house in the very centre of the city , and there , like a good landlord , she kept a good housekeeper . 
In a development which has been termed the  transfiguration ,  which is an alteration of the form of an object , such as a god , a mountain , or the earth , the soul of Bob first attains to a state of perfect felicity , a divine presence , and then to a state of perfection , so that she is able to conduct her life in a way which is so extraordinary , so divinely inspired , and so extraordinary in its character , that one can not help being moved by wonderment at its remarkable objectivity , which is congruous with the highest character , and so acquires the approval of mankind . 
This is a story about Bob . 
My mother always said , if you put Bob on the moon , she would go crazy . 
Projected on the roof of the palace , in the centre of the capital , a huge yellow - green globe , resembling a ball of wax , and measuring 60 feet in diameter , which bore a striking resemblance to the domestic globe of a country house or apartment ; and at the same time it resembled a similar globe which was situated in the neighbourhood , and which was the object of the extensive industry which , as we have seen , had been the principal object of every enterprise which Bob had occasion to undertake during the reign of her father , and for which she was very highly esteemed , and 
The air grew still as Bob entered the main door of the old office , but she was ready .

There was Bob , and she liked to read , and she liked to look after things and she liked to get along with people and she liked to be left alone and she liked to look after her own happiness and she just liked to know that she had a good life and she said to she , well , she guess she have a good life .

It was the ninth day of the new year , and Bob was sitting on her couch , watching the last of the winter flowers take their turn to bloom in the slightly damp , slightly windless town .

Long lost , centuries ago , in the past of the world , there lived Bob . 
I am the earliest member of the family whose great - grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 , and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by Bob by her immediate family , and , in which she was pastor , that she may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , that Dave was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and she entered into she with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and she married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although she knew she to be an innocent wife , yet she tried to prevent she from marrying , either because she was under fifteen years of age , or else because she was already of marriageable age ; because without Frank's knowledge , and without her grandmother 's consultation , she had died , without a word from she , of an accidental overdose of opium , which she had been prescribed for her ill health . 
Bob had her bony hands and feet enough to accommodate she to a load of cushions ; they made a little coffin for she , so heavy it contained four bales of straw .

Bob stood on the deck of the ship as the sun sank into the , an unending gaze , in which she had both contempt and fascination . 
The florins were in the kitchen when Bob heard the doorbell ring , and she smiled and peered into the frame to see what the matter was , but she soon realised that it was nothing more than a routine visit from a very concerned older woman who had been wishing to purchase a piece of art , and who was very sorry to see that the artist 's work was not what she had hoped for . 
After Bob was expelled from Hogwarts , and before she became an Auror , and before her mother became a million miles away , she knew that she would never be as bright as her father , and as bright as she wished she could be . 
It was a short , hot afternoon at the end of August ; Bob told she , before the sun rose , that she was about to start her night shift , and change her clothes . 
Guilt began to creep over Bob when she was twelve . 
When Bob was fifteen , she had a dream in which she was swimming in a vast , blue and white ocean , where vast and billowy black things fluttered gently and softly in the calm breeze . 
Bob had been put out of her misery , but she had not been without a struggle for days ; she had actually considered she unlucky . 
The golden door was the only light in Bob's room , but she knew she must get out if she was going to live .

Bob knew how to get her mistress pregnant ; but her mistress was n't exactly what she had in mind . 
Bob was dead , but she was gone : how could she have known that she was dead ? 
 Hush , Dave ,  said the gleam in Bob's eyes as she watched she run barefoot through the streets of London . 
Bob shook her head dismissively as she watched the boy drift into the station carriages .

There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of Bob , when , as she was often apt to say ,  it was a game of chance , ye good folk  ( she was well aware that what she was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when Dave is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that she finds she in possession of nothing but her own mind and the power of her imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that she finds she in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of her imagination . 
The silvery , lustreless dress , which Bob had bought for £ 20 , which she had made she and which Dave had thrown away because she had no more money , gave she extreme suspicion of that madwoman , who was either a prostitute or an insane person , but she did not like either of them . 
When I was a boy Bob , always had a large library in which she kept all that she had learned in her medical profession , in addition to all the books which she had in her room . 
Bob had brought home three sets of glasses and a large enough bag to keep them all , an obvious precaution since there was no way of knowing what she 'd be up against , especially when she was n't simply playing chess or poker or bowling . 
It was around eleven o'clock and it had been almost two months since Bob's mother had died — three , in fact , if you include the time she 'd spent in temporary hospital and the time of great pain and suffering she 'd been through .

 Bob was one of those who , during the last days of her life , and was never heard of again , fled into the great jungles of the interior of North America , and there perished under the gloomy and deadly care of a race of cannibals ,  said Dr. Ketch , in a long catalogue of the frightful transactions of the last years of his life .

Bob set out for the farm at the end of the summer to take her share of the stock she had bought with her father 's money , which , in the course of the last year , had increased to three millions of dollars , and which , at the time that Mr. George J.

Bob had such a huge view of the sea that her mind seemed to be made up of seas : the wide , deep sheets that covered the vast north and south coasts , the black , under - sea channels that ran behind and in front of the archipelago , the glen which jutted out into the horizon to give a vast , rounded and sheltered edifice , and from which the narrow , narrow passages into the bowels of the ship , lined with luxuriant heather , sheltered the crew ; and the skies above all , where the blue - grey stars shone in their true blue glory , and the red stars which now flapped and twinkled in the night , of the moon and the stars , were all dreams to she . 
Bob was an ugly boy , and she knew it , and she just wanted to be loved . 
Bob's father never taught she to be a real man : to be a real man , in the proper sense of the word , with a true mind and a real purpose , a man who was not only his son , but had the advantage of her family , both ancestors and friends , and an equal share of the luck and fortune which they enjoyed .

On the very day the world was to begin to change , Bob , did the most ridiculous thing that ever happened to she , and that is to have succeeded in changing the most important meeting of the village house into a hideous pantomime of torture , murder , and mayhem . 
The summer Bob left home , she lost an arm . 
Bob was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at her wife and son while she sat in her comfortable chair . 
There are many people who do not know it , but who know it very well , who say that men are born with Bob to 
As Bob sat in her study at Hogwarts , thinking , the boy in the tall green hat was staring at she with a look of wonder and admiration that rivaled any other eye in the world . 
It 's a rainy Saturday afternoon in September and the house in which Bob had lived since the start of house - breaking , when she had first seen the ghost house and had first dreamed of running away to the woods , or of jumping a tall , lopsided tree on top of a hill and the moon floating in the sky . 
 Bob's name is Harry Potter ,  insisted she , shrugging her shoulders and turning her attention to the board in her hands , busy thinking about what she was going to do with her life . 
Bob was a black - haired , skinny thirteen - year - old boy , who , like so many other young people in the late nineteenth century , was surprised to find out that she was going to be a man , and to live a long , long life . 
Bob did not like the way she looked . 
Bob had no name , and no business of her own , but she had been told many a great lie , and none of them made a hair 's breadth more certain . 
Not long after Bob had finished her story she heard a voice speak from the woods . 
Unlike many high - class accountants in Paris , who ride in on a camel , or even a donkey , which is considerably larger , and which is slower than the standard coach , Bob rarely rode a mule , and she was very glad when she did ride a mule , because it enabled she to do all kinds of things within the limits of her strength . 
There was once Bob , for she always had the same unkind name , and she never liked to be called that . 
Bob had a very good eye , her friend said , and looked after her money . 
Not long ago Bob came at last to her senses , and thought that she must be out of a job . 
For the past two weeks , Bob had been a hulking , cold - eyed thing , a monster of the Most Horrific , though some described she as placid . 
In the seat opposite our coach - room , in the apartments where the servants are now provided , there remained Bob ; but now , for some years past , she had come to be known only as Mr. Lisle , and it seems that nobody knew she better than she did . 
One morning , however , the fantastic form of the wizard Tam asked Bob if she had any idea what a plot was . 
 Yes , Bob wants me to kill she !  cried the boy . 
 Bob 'm reading this book to her son , and she do n't think anyone else here has the same idea ,  said she as she stood up and walked over to the book shelf . 
When Bob sat down to read from the Book of the Law , she had only one intention and that was to banish the evil spirit , whose name was Eberhard . 
Bob is a handsome , lanky fellow , with a black beard and a black - rimmed eye , and she is a very good man , for all the good she has done . 
In the year of our Lord 1184 , Bob received a letter written by her friends , in which they congratulated she for her success in a certain career in which she had been offered a fortune . 
In the year of our Lord , Bob , was expelled from the University of Stirling , because she had attempted to overthrow a treaty of peace made between the university and the Royal Society , which was published in the Royal Society 's organ for the time , and was dated the previous October , 1783 . 
On the night when the corpse of Bob ( for I am not about to say who it was who murdered she ) was found , The Lady Coltrin , the widow of the late and lamented Lord Herveyth , who had the honour of being the mother of the great and celebrated Lord Herveyth , died , a very unhappy death , which was neither premeditated nor foreseen . 
When I first met Bob in the college , she was professing a ' respectable ' course of studies , and she was well known , both in the neighbourhood of North Cambridge and in the country , as a member of the Acobalt House , or ' House of the Green - Bears , ' which was a house belonging to a wealthy family in the neighbourhood , and which involved no difficulty whatever in obtaining one 's entrance — except that , as the title of the house implied , it was situated in the midst of a wide and commodious country , which , with many advantages , particularly in manufactures , was of great import , and which was a delicate and delicate occupation in those days . 
Bob's life had been much the same since she had first stood on a sleeping bag and walked through the night . 
There were many things that Bob said that were not true , and some that she said that was not true , but there was one thing that she said or that she said or did or said or said that was true . 
There was once a man who was well known , and known very well , for the one thing Bob had in common with every other man in the world , though she did not know it at the time she was doing what every other man in the world did , she had in common with the man who was named Thomas , with the same qualifications , and quite at the same time , however , she possessed some things which no man in the world possessed : she had both the good and the bad of the human species ; and there is no one who finds more good in human nature than the man who has done no other good than what she had done on her own account , but had done it all on the goodwill of her country and her countrymen . 
Until Bob's mind was shut out by a mask of sanity and fear , she had only seen things as they really were . 
The last things Bob heard said she was going to die . 
Bob was down in the basement preparing to play her music in a small VCR when the babysitter called she over . 
 It 's well ,  said Bob as she strode purposefully into the room . 
Legends speak of a time when angels walked among men ; that when Dave was brought up in a house of Bob , the angel of she came down from heaven to plead with she ; that she prevailed by her grace and power upon the truth of his pleadings ; for of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , the greatest was Frank : and yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet she was esteemed in the sight of she , not by her own merit , but for the work that she had done ; neither was she despised in the sight of she : but she was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of she : and it came to pass , that she was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of she ; but before she was even named , she was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others . 
There was Bob there , but I do n't know if I liked she , and she did n't care whether I did or did n't like she . 
Bob had the misfortune to be born in a large and well - ordered house on which she had been born and reared , and which her grandfather had purchased for a gift for she . 
 Bob wish it was a story ,  said she , holding out her pinky index finger , which she dubbed  super - power  , to the little boy .

The first time Bob saw the light of the day was when her mother died , in a car crash .

Bob was not the type of person to leave her house without a key ; nor was she the type to do less than that .

As the sun rose in the garden Bob landed on her feet , stretched out on the grass and shook the dust from her boots . 
After Bob was married to Linda the toys were gone and when she woke up she found she in a tiny room colored a bright crimson against a pale blue sky . 
The night before they set out to find him , Bob believed that the world was ending and she was going to die . 
Bob , had been watching the stock markets for a few hours when she heard the news . 
On the afternoon of February 21st , 1780 , I was travelling with Bob , through the streets and alleys of London , when she passed me in a room in the Campus of Trinity College , where she was reading an article in the New - York Tribune , while we were walking between Eton two miles away . 
In early 2013 , Bob , started a website called Truth-ism.com , to which - on the day of her death , she dedicated a new page , titled  Truthism ,  with the same title and the same content .

Bob laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of her knees . 
On the morning of the birthday Bob had promised to give to her mother , Dave had the birthday party laid for she . 
Bob made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of a dead woman , but she did not allow the dark - haired widow to remain there . 
As Bob thought , she lifted her head up to look around her bright blue house , and for a moment , she thought she saw a long , dark , empty room , with little else than a door and a rickety stove . 
It is the duty of Bob to help Dave . 
The next day , after Bob had sent for the servants , she lay down on the front steps of the Black family house and watched as her mother poured cup after cup of tea for the household and the servants . 
When Bob , left the village at seventeen years of age and started for the farm , she was a lanky little fellow , and although she was not accustomed to the rough country life and the heat of the winter , yet she was not destitute of good sense or good sense , however hardened and difficult this may have been for she ; and in these latter points she was very faithful indeed ; for she always had in her mind one thing in mind ; that she ought to be a farmer , even though she might have to starve . 
Once , Bob was n't sure she wanted to be a wizard and then believe what she was told . 
It is a story about Bob and a boy who died several times , killed children , and who in the end grew to be nothing less than a menace to the peace of the world . 
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of Bob's , once said ,  I am afraid , she , that when her friend is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and she 's got all sorts of things on her conscience , but when she is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble .  
 It was a hot day ,  said Bob , as she sat down at the table in the dining - room , which was in the

A smile crossed Bob's face as she sat up in bed and jerked her legs . 
On the last night of Bob's life she dreamed of the dream at the bottom of a well . 
Once in a very long while Bob will make a fool of she , and because she was an idiot she got she into a lot of trouble she . 
Dipping Bob's finger into the bottle of a tiny silver tumbler , she lifted it to her lips . 
Bob had spent a long time in her life watching her friends grow , and she had grown sick of it .

At the time Bob had not even heard of the Winter Sickness , but she knew everything about it . 
 When Bob said that one wizard wanted to have you killed , she was n't exaggerating .  
 Good - by , young hero ,  Bob said as she pulled the hood up . 
 That 's not the problem with the world , is it ?  said Bob as she looked down at the pile of dusty papers on the table . 
 You 're not going to believe it ,  said Bob as she opened the stack of papers on the table .

One day , when Bob was 13 and Cecil was only five , their mother took she to see the ancient statue of the Roman emperor Antonius . 
Bob had been walking her entire life . she was seventeen , she had a job , and she was going to go to Hogwarts . 
Bob blinked , now that she had fully recovered from the overwhelming sense of relief during the dance as the nine people who had been invited to the ball had all been eliminated , and she was sitting with her back arched and her head hanging down , and she thought for a moment about what she was going to say in the next few moments . 
Bob came to she through the bar , and she – opened her eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was . 
Bob , was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but she was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and Dave , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with she , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which she had acquired , in a short time , because she had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in her head , and had believed that she was always to find some necessary article for her use in some remote corner of the earth , which she had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality . 
Bob had known nothing but blows from the very beginning , even before she became a hydra .

 Bob have seen her fair share of pain ,  she said . 
Some days ago I was sitting down at the kitchen table at Mary 's to finish a little bill for the woodworking shop , when I began to recall a good while back my father , who was a good - looking , well - to - do farmer who had in the last few years become a very wealthy man not only of Bob's own land but of her own money , and who had been very careful , as a matter of course , to keep up with all the latest inventions and discoveries made in the field of agriculture , and who had , as a good - natured example , added to the wealth of her country an immense amount , and whom I have never forgotten her great credit to maintain because she had carried on the work of her father at the same time of doing it , though not without much expense , and had yet enabled she to do much more than she had done before . 
Bob did not like to be disturbed , and she would not have it otherwise . 
One lovely day Bob was walking through the meadow and up to her house . 
Quietly Bob observed that her friend was the very picture of quiet and serene . 
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that Bob , after sitting on her throne as though she had been sitting for days , died . 
Nobody knows how long Bob was dead , but she had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when she was six or seven . 
Bob , stood before her desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that she held in her magic hand . 
Just before Bob was to die , she , was surprised to find she at a loss for words . 
On a summer 's day in the summer of that year , when the sky and the white of the mountains had been so far blotted out that it was only the deep blue as their backdrop , Bob was walking along the road between her parents ' residence and the house where her father was waiting to drive she home . 
It is to the great credit of Bob that Dave is now living , and the only fault on which she is minded is that she has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to her own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on she a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development . 
I have stayed on at Bob's Hotel since the Titanic disappeared ; and if there was ever any doubt as to the character of she , it proved in every respect that she was as much a gentleman as a gentleman could be .

Bob left the room ; an amount of time must have elapsed since she had entered the room , since she had dismissed the servants , and had placed her hand upon the double door , and had raised it slightly , so as to let the light of the morning through . 
The idea had never entered Bob's mind that she might one day one day , one day , make it to the top of Death . 
When the day of a third world war comes , and Bob has her minders ready to give she permission to start it , when the full might of the Third Reich is at her command , that is how I know I am going to die .

There was once a year , when the grapevines were ripe and they were ready to sing , when Bob , went to the Fountain of the Red Gallows in west and north - east France , and there fell from the sky ten thousand pretty little green hens , and that she had done it so miraculously that they all thought she had done it many times over . 
Bob , was always a little too young to know what she really wanted , that was , except perhaps to know what she was really afraid of . 
Barefoot lay by the side of Bob's aunt 's house in the woods of Gower , where she had spent the good part of her childhood , weeping heartily over her aunt 's death . 
Eyes of a child , and ears of an old man , and a mind of a man , and a mind that loved truth and the laws of the land , and who , if questioned , would not have the least suspicion of Bob's age — if she were any other age — would have told me that I had been hit by lightning .

 Bob huffed , but she did n't puff .  
Bob was an old man when she met Dr. Watson . 
It was not without cause that Bob , in her youth , and in her last years , had any thought of taking up her old profession of medicine , and carrying on any kind of practice ; and that she had decided to take up her old profession of medical essay and take up her old profession of Ph.D. instead of , and not at all contrary to , her old profession of mathematics ; and that she had resolved to make the first application for a doctorate , and , from thenceforth , carry on any practice that she pleased ; and that , in consequence of this resolution and determination , she had been prepared to put down her old career of professional medicine , and to find a new , comfortable profession , in which , indeed , she had every pleasure . 
Bob could n't have been more than ten years old when she rose to break her neck in the family crypt . 
Any man who knew the legend of Bob would rejoice to hear that in her time she not only had a flying horse , but a mighty and plump one , full of jewels , and a head of fine hair , and that when she put it to practical use it turned out to be an astute guide , and that when she had finished her career she had no difficulty in obtaining a place of honour , or at least to be distinguished .

In a development which has been termed the  transfiguration ,  which is an alteration of the form of an object , such as a god , a mountain , or the earth , the soul of Bob first attains to a state of perfect felicity , a divine presence , and then to a state of perfection , so that she is able to conduct her life in a way which is so extraordinary , so divinely inspired , and so extraordinary in its character , that one can not help being moved by wonderment at its remarkable objectivity , which is congruous with the highest character , and so acquires the approval of mankind . 
This is a story about Bob . 
My mother always said , if you put Bob on the moon , she would go crazy . 
Projected on the roof of the palace , in the centre of the capital , a huge yellow - green globe , resembling a ball of wax , and measuring 60 feet in diameter , which bore a striking resemblance to the domestic globe of a country house or apartment ; and at the same time it resembled a similar globe which was situated in the neighbourhood , and which was the object of the extensive industry which , as we have seen , had been the principal object of every enterprise which Bob had occasion to undertake during the reign of her father , and for which she was very highly esteemed , and 
The air grew still as Bob entered the main door of the old office , but she was ready .

I am the earliest member of the family whose great - grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 , and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by Bob by her immediate family , and , in which she was pastor , that she may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , that Dave was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and she entered into she with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and she married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although she knew she to be an innocent wife , yet she tried to prevent she from marrying , either because she was under fifteen years of age , or else because she was already of marriageable age ; because without Frank's knowledge , and without her grandmother 's consultation , she had died , without a word from she , of an accidental overdose of opium , which she had been prescribed for her ill health .

The florins were in the kitchen when Bob heard the doorbell ring , and she smiled and peered into the frame to see what the matter was , but she soon realised that it was nothing more than a routine visit from a very concerned older woman who had been wishing to purchase a piece of art , and who was very sorry to see that the artist 's work was not what she had hoped for . 
After Bob was expelled from Hogwarts , and before she became an Auror , and before her mother became a million miles away , she knew that she would never be as bright as her father , and as bright as she wished she could be .

Bob had such a huge view of the sea that her mind seemed to be made up of seas : the wide , deep sheets that covered the vast north and south coasts , the black , under - sea channels that ran behind and in front of the archipelago , the glen which jutted out into the horizon to give a vast , rounded and sheltered edifice , and from which the narrow , narrow passages into the bowels of the ship , lined with luxuriant heather , sheltered the crew ; and the skies above all , where the blue - grey stars shone in their true blue glory , and the red stars which now flapped and twinkled in the night , of the moon and the stars , were all dreams to she .
