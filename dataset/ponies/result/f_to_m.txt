When Bob and Flutterbottom first met , she had no idea who they were . 
Bob , in the year 1581 , appeared on the scene with a discovery she could not have dreamed of three years before : in the journal of Dave , she found two passages which she named The Book of Dreams . 
There was once Bob : 
Toots , who never knew Bob's parents did not like she , was sitting in the kitchen of her mother 's house , staring up at the ceiling , where magnificent paintings of the gods held the key to the universe . 
It was last Sunday afternoon , before the holiday of satisfaction , that Bob , learned that Dave had been obliged to ask she for her blessing to have the privilege of celebrating the nuptial of her second cousin , the Empress . 
Bob is a man who leads a simple life , that is , she does not depend on fortune or gifts of nature for happiness . 
Bob was hunting down a rabbit when she heard the awful noise of the gunfight . 
It was the first day of spring in the year of Bob's coronation , and Lady Margaret of the Forest of the Southern Sea was up at the royal court to welcome she to the throne ; but the weather had already turned hot and dry and the first - born were already starting to be gone . 
When we count the dead in the Town of the Rivers , we do n't really know what we 're talking about ; for these are the very rivers that flow through this important city of the British Empire , and through which , during the sixteen years of the reign of King Henry I. , Bob , of the year of his coronation , made such a marked contribution to the commercial and military prosperity of the city of London , that , when she departed , she found with what an affection and tenderness of mind and mind alone did she devote she to the administrative and financial affairs of the city , and was so much astonished by the extraordinary extent of the public debt that she waited until she had collected a sufficient sum of money from the public , before she was obliged to admit her own helplessness and to employ her entire energies in the pressing business of default during some years of the reign of King Henry I. 
When Bob was thirteen years old she dated her first book ,  In a Sentence or an Exposition , she Have the Honour to Write ,  for something like three months , noting the date , and so casting some doubt 
 I would n't trust Bob , if only she were real . I 'd give she my tongue ,  said the gleam of her unicorn horn in Pinkie Pie 's pearly paling eyes . 
When Bob was killed , it happened that she had six daughters , two known to the world , and two known to her friends and family . 
Bob usually sat at her desk and wrote in a notebook . 
Bob was a man of the people , and at the time that she was travelling so very far , that she was not aware of its importance . 
The day Bob tried to kill she was the first night of her life . 
Bob was sitting on the edge of a tarpaulin in a crowded room with the windows down when the voice whispered in her ear . 
The day Bob hurt she in an automobile accident was the first day of her life . 
Bob watched in horror as she watched another man die . 
Near the end of the last century , it may be , there came as a terrible surprise to Bob , that from the first days of the world until the end of the last , she had not been able to reckon with one hundred and fifty millions of years . 
The first day I ever met Bob on the loose - leafed hills of the Colorado , a rattlesnake had slashed her leg , severing a lot of flesh and leaving she with one leg . 
Bob sat on a rock on the banks of her stream and stared out at the water in disbelief .  That 's impossible , Rarity ,  she said ,  that 's impossible , even for great magic !  
Bob twirled the peg - leg around in her eyes , and the tough leather straps under her arms , as she stood on the platform of one of the other ships that crowded the bottom of the middle city . 
After the great battle of Jerusalem , when all the world was red and white in the face of a great victory , in which all the powers of Europe shared , Bob , recovered her senses and , though her body was still in a state of weariness and disuse , her spirit and her mind were refreshed and improved in spirit ; she became more full of energy and activity , eager to promote her empire , and to aid and assist the conquered armies . 
Bob had a solid build , and a big , broad smile on her face . 
Venerable Menepaul of the Devil 's Church , 88th floor , and such - like members of Bob's order as lay there , assembled in a noble room to witness the re - enactment , which was to take place on the roof of the beautiful Boston house of the late Mr. Sir Thomas Brockman , at which she was first lodged . 
The night Bob first glimpsed her future , she woke from an intense dream to find she , and she alone , in a vast garden , surrounded by a crowd of people , and a historian , a naturalist , and a sculptor , and racing horses , and one or two ladies standing upon a hill . 
On the summer day that Bob was born , she , with a weakling 's mind and thin frame , was drowned . 
It was the eleventh year of Bob's life , and she had been so busy with business of which she did not know at the time just how many it involved — foremost of all , business in the real world . 
Bob had heard the talk of a great city , but she had never seen any of it . 
The river flowed clean and clear through the woods of the north west ; and from the banks of the river it seemed , on every side , the exception to the general rule , that some years back , whatever the prevailing climate of the region , Bob had appeared on the banks of that river as a human being ; and , in reality , had been a human being ; having been a man , and had been , or had been , of every human class ; and had been , or had been , of every human race ; and had been , or had been , of one or another kind of body ; and had possessed more or less of two or three kinds of intelligence ; and had been distinguished from her fellows by some characteristic qualities peculiar to the particular kind of river , or stream , or other watercourse , or channel , or channel by which it was obtained ; and had been , or had been , however , the object of abhorrent or even loathsome detestable treatment ; and had been , or had been , either tortured or executed for the crime of attempting to escape from the jurisdiction of any superior authority ; had been , or had been , unwilling either to help the persecutors or to defend she ; had been , or had been willing to do anything to prevent her persecutors from killing , or setting out to kill , she ; and had been , or at any rate , had believed she to be , innocent ; no less a judge or magistrate than a criminal had charged she . 
 You 're gon na eat Bob ,  said she as she lay down on the sand ,  but do n't kill she .  
One day , on a cold , grey day , Bob , was driving down the main thoroughfares of London , when she saw in the distance what looked to she like some vast city , on a smooth , grey sea , or in the language of the coast - men , a very large port , with many large ships , with a very strong trading post , and without a minute 's notice , she drove on into the world of the great traders and navigators . 
It was not long ago , when Bob first visited the forest , that she had come across a herd of very lean , very short - legged geldings , without heads or tails , that were waiting for the moon to rise . 
 Just ... leave Bob alone , please ,  Rarity said .  she might not be a good unicorn , but she 's not going anywhere .  
Not long ago , when Bob was a boy , when she only knew how to read and write , she sent her mother a card that read : Beg for your help . 
Bob sat in the saddle and considered the plan she 'd been given . 
Bob had nothing to do with it , ” she said . 
Bob's summer vacation had taken she halfway around the world , and by this time she was beginning to get tired of these ridiculously long journeys . 
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment Bob took her seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy . 
 Bob 've got a comet ,  she said to the sailors of the Thames . 
When Bob was twelve years old , she invented the flotilla technique . 
Bob's eyeball was still open and her gaze was wandering , but she was sure there was something under the surface of the water . 
Manton discovered the existence of the world in a paper which was stuck on the back of Bob's desk , and which she picked up and read from time to time . 
The sun sat on its apex and its smooth black slopes in a land of full greenness , with the summer air of a land of promise and promise 's bustle and its promise , the promise of the stars and the promise of the earth itself , a land where there was no sin and no hate nor any fear , where there was no man 's fault and no man 's fault 's fault , where there was no bad behavior nor any bad habit nor any bad character , where there was no evil in the eyes of Bob , where there was no evil that should escape she , nor any evil that should escape she , nor any evil or bad spirit , no Lord , no God , no God nor any spirit , near she or in her name , or any thing that is not in she . 
Your Majesty , it has come to pass in heaven , that there is Bob ; she can well remember what events have taken place in history . 
The first time Bob let out a long whiny howl , the servant woke up the neighbor who lived in the house next door to she . 
Rain came from the sky as if Bob had been pulled out of the deep dark , and her shoes and coat clattered on the wet asphalt below . 
On the night Bob fell to her death , she did not dream that she was going to die . 
The steel doors of the City - Ship slid open and Bob stepped out , her left arm crossed over her chest , as though she were about to slide into oblivion . 
The first time Bob had a dream , it was the morning after her mother had died of ovarian cancer and , the night before , she had spent the night in a hospital room with a needle in her arm and a tube in her leg . 
Bob said she was going to steal my twin sisters , but I thought she was joking . 
Bob should have known it , for she was such a fool in the beginning . 
Bob rose from among the ruins of the great forest , and at first sight , she appeared to be nothing more than a helpless , ragged visitor . 
In the midst of the great maze of blind alleys and crumbling buildings of London , on a sunny summer day in the year 1665 , Bob was able to enjoy the quiet hours of her childhood when she alighted on streets where she could chat with pedestrians and shopkeepers without arousing suspicion . 
It was an apartment in the town on the river , and until one morning when Bob woke from a nightmare and rushed to the door , she had no idea what she had gotten she into . 
The sun was setting on the day that Ephron called Bob to understand that she had overshot her task . 
There was Bob , but she was no great man , and she had no money . 
When Bob , was old enough to buy a horse and carriage , and had the least money in the world , she had the honor of buying one of what was then called the ' Baron 's Money - House ' in the street of St. Mary 's , where she now lives in a flat and furnished house , with a garden and a verandah , but in which there are scarcely twenty - five persons in the whole of it ; and she has lived , as she told it in the story , for ever and ever , without having any friends or any personal possessions of any sort ; not even the slightest money , and when she speaks of her possessions it is in the sense of plenty of things ; but she has never been in want of anything , or of anything of any importance , in the whole world , or in her whole lifetime ; and she certainly never has been in any very ill - fortune ; and yet she has been in many indeed fortunate and fortunate circumstances and has been in many fortunes of all kinds and all kinds ; and though she has never been in any financial difficulty , and if she had any doubt of that , she would have no doubt of it now , she has never been in a position of great or great inconvenience or difficulty ; and yet there have been times when she thought it all over , and when she found that she was so poor and so wretched that she could not possibly have amassed so much wealth in her lifetime ; and she had thought that she was much richer than she really was ; but there has never been any way of testing this , nor any way of having any thing like determination in the matter , which , if it had been possible , she would not have known how to work out for she ; and although she had long been in disuse , she had never had any taste for anything beyond the ordinary necessities of life ; and though , for long years she had been content as regards material things , the happy result had been , no doubt , that she had been at no loss for a career lasting an indefinite number of years , during which she had not failed in obtaining a livelihood whose success she had long known , or rather had been absolutely certain of , and had ever been fully conscious of ; and though for many years after she had ceased to be in want of any sort of material comforts , and even for a livelihood of a very temporal character , or of material comfort , within the smaller limits of the earth ; and though perhaps there had been times when she had been in some circumstances in which she had been doing better than she truly was ; at any rate , she had been in every respect in which she might have been expected to perform , in all probability at most one thousandth part of what she had performed , and she had been as perfectly consistent and as industrious as any other person in the world ; not merely in her own mind , but also in the whole body of her society ; and this proved that she had never been in any sort of distress . 
Deep within a blue - green void , Bob , and this she was very much proud of she , like a proud and very happy man , very much pleased with himself , in the same way as a proud and very happy man is very happy with himself . 
Moonlight wings spread in a spring breeze , danced above a valley , and amid the trees and the wildflowers of Equestria , Bob , after a long hunt , found the body of a strange little pony who had been snatched from she by a couple of rude villagers . 
 At least Bob 'm not going to eat them ,  said she — fully aware that she was packing a bag full of the pastries in case she ran into an unusual custom in the future , and in anticipation of Croaking to find a new friend to eat with . 
 Bob think that 's it , then , her dear friend ,  said she as she turned her back on the landscape ,  and all will be well . she am free , though she doubt it . Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely . Oh , I know it 's a bad idea . she was at a party once .  
Bob said she was afraid of ghosts . 
I first met Bob when she was nineteen years old and she was working as a dressmaker in the East End of London . 
Twelve days were only sufficient to give Bob a measure of rest , and for three days they warmed she in the cold , but on the third day the heat of the weather came upon she again , and on the sixth day a sense of despair came over she ; but on the ninth day , when her fever was beginning to subside , the fever of peace was beginning to subside . 
The honeymoon of Bob's eighteenth year , when she 
Bob was locked up , and she was not a very good man , but she was not stupid either . 
Bob had also been hoping that she had died in an airplane accident . 
Bob was always in the kitchen , but she was never out of coffee . 
The empty oven still hurt Bob's eyes when she stood over the brim . 
Bob , sitting crosslegged on a damp stone floor , had a cigarette lighter in each hand , and a bundle of twigs in front of she , containing nothing but a wide - brimmed hat and a pair of straw gloves . 
Bob was a man of genius , even when she was young , and one who carried on her mind without restraint the deep doctrine of national devotion which was then in fashion . 
One minute Bob was standing in front of her desk , examining the file she had been given . 
Bob may be in the third year of her best and brightest year , but she 's not going anywhere . 
Some time in the latter half of the eighteenth century , Bob , set out to steal the title of Ruben de Vros , notwithstanding the great advantages which she had acquired by her skill in the art of card - playing . 
It is a month of extreme hardship for the widow of the old wizard , and Bob can not possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before she . 
Glittering with the colors of magic , Bob blinked widely , as though she were trying to find the light . 
The U - Boat crash into the moor ( the story goes , as per the account of Bob , that she had heard first of it from a friend of she who had been aboard Dave , when she saw a ship that unlike she , was large , and that it was covered with a mantle of splinters , and in which she thought it possible the corpse of a man , but who had been murdered in some strange way , might have come . 
There was Bob . 
All the kids who went to school in the little green - hall were pretty , but if Bob had been ten years old , she would have known by a glance that a great deal of activity lay ahead of she . 
Bob had the gall to tell us that she had made an incursion into the kingdom of Henry the Second , and that she had been interested , though she had not been interested in the slightest degree . 
There was no doubt in either the mind of the spectator or the mind of the scientist or the ear of either that Bob was right when she said that a planet orbits a sun . 
When Bob was sixteen , she was sitting alone in her room , thinking of her future after the war . 
Marek was smiling when Bob said to Dave ,  she would like to introduce she to Cadence .  
Bob ... he ! she ... is ! 
 It 's a cold dead end ,  said Bob as she put up the last of the last of the white slacks that covered the back of the carriage . 
There was once Bob ; she was named John . 
Once upon a time , when the world was young , Bob was walking home one cold Thursday evening in August , and she came upon a little stone church on a green and flowery street , or in better letters Rickson , on the south side of that city , in which the main thoroughfares led down to the narrow streets and galleries of the lower part of the town . 
Bob , ' in my modest opinion , was walking home in her own shoes , with her hat on , from the back of the church , where she had been having the rough passage due to she , and which was 
The Emperor of the Day , who , according to the law of physics , died in the year of five thousand eight hundred and two , gave to Bob the title of Emperor , and naturally this title made she powerful , and this powerful so that she could make a bargain with anybody . 
Bob had been playing for hours , and the time had come for she to break out of her gloomy cell and play . 
Bob sat and watched the sun go down slowly , with her eyes closed . 
A young man , a man of twenty four , Bob had the name of Erland , but for all that she was not a very good liar . 
At first Bob just thought of she , and was happy . 
As Bob stood at her office door , waiting to be summoned , she noticed that the door was open . 
 Send a runner ,  said Bob , and she made a noticeable effort to be friendly , although she knew well enough from her long experience in the city that the term seemed more than a little strange to she . 
Bob had been walking very slow all morning , reaching her destination in the town of Trafalgar , about eight miles south of Manchester . 
Bob had dropped into the school , not knowing why she was there ; it was as though she 'd been dropped into the middle of nowhere . 
In the year of our Lord 2001 , Bob , was sitting in the chair , with her hat on the mantelpiece , and the smaller man next to she , which was a very strange arrangement . 
 Well you 've done well indeed ,  said Bob , as she sat down next to her brother , looking up at the heavens above them with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity . 
There was Bob in the full light of the morning , and she was 
Bob thought she was the only unicorn . 
 Dorytheus , please get up ,  said Bob as she took the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor . 
When Bob was ten , at the age of fourteen , she was invited to a party . 
They were two blocks from the school door and three blocks from the flat that always seemed to be the last place to put Bob when she went to sleep . 
Bob was stabbed in the throat , her heart ripped apart by the knife . 
Miffal Bob was imprisoned no less than twenty - seven times on the Disc of the Dead , and it has been since then that she has been allowed a solitary passage out of her cell . 
After Bob had left her wife alone in the garden , she went to pick up the newspaper and dipped it into her cupboard , wishing she had a camera and a memory of where she had put it the week before . 
 Time 's up , Brute ,  Bob shouted down at the young man next to she . 
Ever since the day Bob was born , she has asked she what she was really made of , and yet always comes away with the same conclusion : she is a very odd little thing indeed ! 
In the days when Bob tried to forget or suppress all sense of history , she made a point of discussing her own ministry with her fellow church members and those whom she met through the temple . 
The House of Parliament , in the house of the Lords , had passed an act , which Bob expressly reserved to she , for a certain purposes , and without any previous consent of she , which provided , that  the title of she , for the whole period that she was under 
By the time Bob reached her limits , she was an ordinary young man -- not quite fourteen , but in the right sort of body . 
In the year 1838 , Bob , published her scientific treatise , entitled ,  Energetic Forces and Energy ,  in which she distinguishes between the forms of energy , invisible to the senses , and those which have a definite object , the third and highest form of Energy . 
Bob was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made her fortune by , and in fact made her fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which she has adopted to capitalize upon her great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which her mother enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter . 
Bob 'd never known his father did n't like she . 
When you 're thrown out of a castle into the wilds of October , and there 's Bob there , and she has been murdered , and she has been hoping to be rid of she for a hundred years , you think the world is over . 
And tearing Bob's father 's arm off , she did not spring a foot . 
Bob was riding in the midst of a dry and calm autumn season , riding on clear , and she knew that the wind of Britain was blowing , and that she was safe and that she would have to ride on — it was a familiar feeling to she — and she was riding on comfortable white , and she knew that the air was cool and that if she was found hanged she could always lie down for a long time and sleep peacefully and rest easy . 
There was an old man on a horse , Bob , she , yet she had the heart of a man , and was very much of this world ; but she had neither the strength nor the patience for weariness nor for labor , nor was she ever mowing grass alone .
